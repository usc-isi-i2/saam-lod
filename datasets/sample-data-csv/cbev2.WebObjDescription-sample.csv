Antonio’s friend Portia is dressed as a judge trying to bargain with Shylock. Upon the suggestion that a surgeon be present when the flesh is extracted, Shylock challenges, “Is it so nominated in the bond?” to which Portia replies, “It is not so express’d; but what of that? ‘Twere good you do so much for charity.”"

By the time Twachtman painted his Connecticut landscapes, American artists and intellectuals had been interested in Buddhism for more than two decades, and the artist himself had studied Zen philosophy and Japanese art. (Pyne, "John Twachtman and the Therapeutic Landscape," in Chotner et al., <i>John Twachtman: Connecticut Landscapes</i>, 1989) This may account for the meditative quality of his pictures, the sense of looking not at an actual landscape, but at an inward image of something seen long before.</p>"

Typically, American artists would settle in Paris but also make regular excursions into the French countryside, where they could paint outdoors. Theodore Robinson was among a group of American painters who began to visit Giverny, where the French impressionist painter Claude Monet had settled in 1883. Robinson's friendship with Monet greatly influenced his technique in this period and manifested itself most significantly in the loose brushstrokes that indicate color and light.
