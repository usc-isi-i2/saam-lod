"5","Artist Biography","<P>"Paris was where the 20th century was." Should the remark so often quoted and attributed to Gertrude Stein prove apocryphal, it would make no difference. At the turn of the century and again after World War I, it seemed that most of the artistic and literary ferment of the modern world was focused in that city. To Paris in the 1920s came Berenice Abbott, a young woman fresh from Ohio State University's School of Journalism and from New York's Greenwich Village. Yet, despite this experience, she was still looking for her career, for her real profession and life's work. Born in Ohio in 1898, she had spent unhappy early years as the child of divorced parents and, after attending Ohio State University, had left the Midwest (for good) in 1918 for New York city and the Village. Ostensibly she was seeking a career in journalism and had moved to New York intending to pursue that subject at Columbia University. In fact the move to New York only presaged another in 1921, this time to Paris to study sculpture. "You're finding yourself as you go along when you're young,"she has remarked. "Youth often enters a field that isn't always the right choice." (1)</P>
<P>Her discovery of the right field came in 1923 and seems to have been entirely serendipitous. The famous photographer Man Ray needed an assistant, but insisted on one without previous knowledge of the craft. Young expatriates must eat, and Abbott applied. Her lack of knowledge qualified her for the job. Soon she was printing for Man Ray and discovering that she immensely enjoyed doing darkroom work. Later, at his suggestion, Abbott began to take her own first photographs. Both were surprised to discover how good she was. By 1925, with the aid of loans from Peggy Guggenheim and from Robert McAlmon (one of the "charmed circle" surrounding Gertrude Stein), she had set up her own studio on the Left Bank. There she pursued portrait photography which absorbed her at that time.</P>
<P>A selection of images of the stream of notables who found their way to Berenice Abbott's studio are presented in this exhibition. Figures from the world of fashion and the haut monde of Parisian society mix freely with some of the era's legendary literary figures and artists, including the dadaists and surrealists out <I>pour épater le bourgeois.</I> Abbott presents them all with what one can only term an imaginative realism.</P>
<P>Each subject was extremely important to her. "I wasn't trying to make a still life of them," she has said, "but a person. Its a kind of exchange between people—it has to be—and I enjoyed it." (2) Formal posing was totally foreign to her approach. Her subjects tend to move casually; frequently they slouch. Occasionally perhaps captured in conversation or interaction with her, they strike self-assertive or deliberately playful stances. Always she is a master at catching the telling gesture (the languid, listless hand of James Joyce) or the detail of dress or accessory (the elegant pince-nez of Mrs. Theodore van Rysselberghe and the large ring on her forefinger) that reveals character as strongly as face or eyes. Less frequently Abbott experimented with arbitrary cropping to create a mood, one to us redolent of the art deco aesthetic first formally presented to Paris and the world in 1925 at L'Exposition internationale des arts décoratifs et industriels modernes. How could she not be aware of and sensitive to the international movements in art that crowded the Paris horizon? Yet, through it all, we sense a serious intelligence and a sturdy individuality developing and gathering force.</P>
<P>The years in Paris also brought an obsession into Abbott's life—the work of the French photographer Eugene Atget (1857–1927). Now some fifty years after his death honored by exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, he was largely unknown or rejected in Paris during the 1920s. (Even as late as 1967 or 1968, Abbott says, the French authorities rejected the Atget collection when she offered it to them through the French Minister of Culture, André Malraux.) Abbott had first become aware of the work of this unrecognized master of photography through Man Ray. The impact of Atget's work on her was immediate and she periodically bought his photographs, as many as she could afford, for a few francs each. After Atget's death she purchased his collection of some 10,000 images—both prints and negatives—from his closest friend, André Calmette. A labor of love followed as Abbott saw that each glass plate negative was cleaned and stored in a numbered glassine envelope. Then she began her long and until recently quite fruitless campaign to have Atget's work recognized. The resistance she met reveals the attitudes of the art world of the day: a preoccupation with abstraction, an abhorrence and denigration of realism as trivial and trite, and grave doubts as to the legitimacy of photography as an art. (The September 1951 issue of <I>Art News,</I> for example introduced an article by Berenice Abbott with the rhetorical questions, "Does photography belong in museums? In fact, is it an art at all?") (3) Abbott's fight for Atget's recognition demanded her time, attention, persistence, and self-sacrifice, often at the expense of her own career.</P>
<P>Despite her success in Paris, by 1929 Abbott was ready to return home. On a visit to America she became excited by New York city. She has said that she became interested in the States from a distance, that some persons abroad become fascinated with their own country. She had left her homeland out of frustration with a country that offered very little encouragement for the arts. Abbott feels that her relocation to Europe was an act of justified rebellion. Yet, she has said that "after years in Paris I found myself drawn by a certain nostalgia and an objective interest [in the United States] that crept up over the years." (4)</P>
<P>Fascinated by New York City and the changes that had occurred in it during her absence, she began the monumental work of documenting its visual presence—its sweeping technological innovations, its bridges, its canyonlike streets overtowered by skyscrapers (many of the most famous under construction at that time), its nineteenth-century brownstones and even earlier vestiges of colonial architecture, its littered streets, its hum and vitality, its sparkling transformation at night into a fairyland of light and glitter. The rest is history. The right artist and the right project—one demanding perseverance, vitality, and great individuality of imagination—had met. Her efforts were finally rewarded in 1935 when the New Deal's Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration agreed to sponsor her documentation of New York under the project title "Changing New York." The book of the same title, published in 1939, was a milestone in the history of photography.</P>
<P>Since 1939 Abbott has engaged in many projects, turning her attention to the photography of scientific phenomena and working for the Physical Science Study Committee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She now lives in rural Maine, where she moved in 1962. She continues to be outspoken in her comments concerning photography which she believes is the most important art form of our time. "It took the modern period to develop an art based on scientific sources, on chemistry and optics. The vision of the twentieth century has been created by photography." (5)</P>
<P>As for realism and the mechanistic aspect of photography, her own summing up of her experience with a camera presents a powerful, lucid argument for the creativity of the photographer and also provides insights into our responses to her photographs:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"By the choice of subject and the special treatment given a subject, [the photograph] is as personal as writing or music; while by the fact that it works with an instrument to record a segment of reality given and already made … it is impersonal, to the highest degree." (6) </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Abbott also believes that "while significant reality is the subject matter of the photographer, it follows that … the choice of subject is inescapably a subjective one. One cannot help equating the objective world with oneself." (7)</P>
<P>We, too, read ourselves into her photographs, experiencing the New York of the 1980s more fully and acutely by savoring her images of the 1930s. Her photographs of both the twenties and the thirties provide us with more than a souvenir, more than a record or document. By an act of creative imagination Berenice Abbott has revealed to us something of the indestructible essence of a place or a time that resists oblivion and change. For many of us, this creative act seems both life-enhancing and revitalizing.</P><BR><BR>

"46","Artist Biography","<p>An elementary school teacher for twelve years, and an instructor at the Bauhaus from 1923  until 1933, Josef Albers was one of the most influential artist-educators to immigrate to the United States during the 1930s. Following early academic training at the Royal Art School in Berlin (1913&ndash;15), the <i>Kunstgewerbeschule</i> in Essen (part-time from 1916 to 1919), and the Art Academy in Munich (1919&ndash;20), Albers turned in 1920 to the innovative atmosphere of the Weimar Bauhaus. There he began his experimental work as an abstract artist. After three years as a student, he was hired to teach the famed Vorkurs, the introductory class that immersed students in the principles of design and the behavior of materials.</p><p>Albers was convinced that students needed to develop an understanding of "the static and dynamic properties of materials. . . through direct experience." His students made constructions with wire netting, matchboxes, phonograph needles, razor blades, and other unusual materials. They also visited workshops where craftsmen worked daily with the structural and behavioral characteristics of industrial and natural materials.(1)</p><p>In his own work, Albers investigated color theory and composition. He began to explore mathematical proportions as a way to achieve balance and unity in his art. Yet, Albers did not aim to be a purely analytical painter. Although he had not taken classes with either Klee or Kandinsky as a Bauhaus student, and did not profess metaphysical concerns, Albers believed that Art is spirit, and only the quality of spirit gives the arts an important place in. . . life."(2)</p><p>Albers had come to his own brand of abstraction over the course of many years. By 1908, he had discovered Matisse and C&#233;zanne, and in Berlin he encountered work by Munch, van Gogh, the German Expressionists, Delaunay, and the Italian Futurists. Initially an expressionist, Albers began experimenting with abstract principles and unusual materials about 1923. His glass assemblages of these formative years explored the possibilities of stained, sandblasted, and constructed arrangements. They are remarkable for their deft incorporation of such "accidental" effects as ripples and bubbles&#151;inherent in the medium itself&#151;into sophisticateddesigns that explored balance, translucence, and opacity.</p><p>Albers had weathered Bauhaus moves from Weimar to Dessau, and then to Berlin, remaining steadfast even after Walter Gropius and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy left in 1928. In 1933, when the Nazis forced the closing of the Berlin Bauhaus, Albers left for America where he introduced Bauhaus concepts of art and design to the newly formed experimental community of Black Mountain College in North Carolina.</p><p>After fifteen years he left Black Mountain and, in 1950, became chairman of the Department of Design at Yale. <i>On Tideland,</i> painted between 1947 and 1955, marks this transition and was painted concurrently with the earliest examples of his well-known series, <i>Homage to the Square.</i></p><p>Albers, always a careful craftsman, was concerned that future generations understand his working methods. He often documented, on the reverse of the fiberboard panels he preferred for his paintings, the pigments, brands, varnishes, and grounds he had used in making the painting. Fascinating notations document his spatial proportions and the mathematic schemes he incorporated in each work. <i>On Tideland,</i> for example, was painted according to "Scheme M," in which twenty units of vertical form balance thirty units of horizontal form. Although concerned with a severely restricted format in his own work, Albers admitted other approaches: "Any form [of art] is acceptable if it is true," he stated. "And if it is true, it's ethical and aesthetic."(3)</p><p>An original member of the American Abstract Artists, Albers showed annually throughout the group's formative years.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"55","Artist Biography","<p>John White Alexander, a native of Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, worked as an illustrator in <i>Harper and Brothers</i> in his youth, just as Winslow Homer had done a decade before. In 1877, White joined the 'Duveneck boys' in Munich, where training, much influenced by Hals, Vel&#225;zquez and Courbet, was freer and looser than that of Paris or Dusseldorf. The work of the Munich artists was often richly brushed in a predominantly dark palette, and although the vogue was brief and was supplanted by the Barbizon and Paris schools, it produced a number of talented Americans, notably Frank Duveneck, William Merritt Chase, John White Alexander, and, John Twachtman.</p><p>In 1891, Alexander moved to Paris and over the next ten years gained prominence as an exponent of the current Art Noveau trend. However this was only one of several influences that converged on him and other artists during these years. In the 1890s proponents of the so-called Aesthetic Movement decried the Ruskinian conviction that art must perform a moral and didactic function and instead asserted that art was autonomous and self-referential. Free of literary, narrative conventions, artists could favor mood over story and assert the formal, evocative properties of color and line for their own sake.</p><p>This new freedom encouraged a shift in subject matter toward the representation of objects and figures that were simply beautiful in themselves. The culture of the 1890s, gritty and ugly as it appeared, produced such subject matter in abundance. The century's end had witnessed the explosive growth of commerce, industry, and urban concentration, contributing to the creation of great fortunes in few hands; it also contributed to a radical adjustment in the social roles of women of the upper and middle classes. Deprived of the centrally productive role they had previously performed in a rural society, women were now relegated to a decorative role, serving as beautiful symbols of male wealth and status. As such they were bountifully represented by artists, and their images were eagerly acquired by patrons. It is noteworthy that in the current exhibition of fifty-two paintings there are twenty-four representations of women, almost exclusively upper class, and only one male self-portrait.</p><p>Alexander's many depictions of beautiful women were also colored by his susceptibility to the prevailing Art Nouveau, an elaborately decorative style that emphasizes the use of sinuous and sensuous contours. This movement was popularized by the drawings of Aubrey Beardsley, the dramatic posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the stained glass of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Alexander's work was also touched by the prevailing vogue for symbolism, the visual evocation of an idea, of an emotion through the association of analogous qualities. </p><p>Emery Battis Artist Biographies for the exhibition <i>American Impressionism: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum</i> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2000)</p>",""

Two years earlier, he had been diagnosed with cancer, possibly caused by the chemicals contained in his art materials. He underwent surgery and was required to return to the hospital numerous times. Despite this serious threat to his health, Arneson injects humor into his self-portrait, even vulgarity. His face seems to be pushed up against a piece of transparent glass that flattens his nose into a piggish snout, while his wild hair and wrinkled features expresss the tension and anxiety that characterize his state of mind. The artist appears like a specimen prepared for a microscopic examination. Areneson frequently turned to self-portraiture as a means to examine his relationship with the world, expressing serious thought and difficult emotional content through the filter of a humorous mask.</p><p>Joann Moser <i>Graphic Masters: Highlights from the Smithsonian American Art Museum</i> (Washington, D.C. : Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2003)</p>",""

"171","Artist Biography","<p>Ault was brought up in England and came late to an appreciation of his American origins. After training at University College School in London, the Slade School, and St. John's Wood School of Art, his painting style was described as an Anglicized version of impressionism. But when he returned to America in 1911 he began to paint New York night scenes and architectural subjects in a spare, modernist style. This caused his father, an academic painter, to stop supporting him. In the 1920s, on vacation in Provincetown, he painted the local scenery in oils and watercolors. These works were shown at a local gallery and in New York. In the early 1930s he worked on New Deal art projects, gradually severing most of his ties with the art market. He moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1937, but avoided life in the art colony there. A nearby barn, which he painted three times, was a favorite subject, symbolizing for hire a dying, agrarian way of life in the Catskills. In this sense his work echoed, from his own modernist viewpoint, the preservationist themes of many New England artists. Ault's life, plagued by illness, depression, and poverty, ended with his suicide in 1948. </p><p>William H. Truettner and Roger B.

"176","Artist Biography","<P>Milton Avery lived in and around Hartford, Connecticut, until 1925, when he moved to New York City. A factory worker as a young man, one day he saw an advertisement for a class in lettering at the Connecticut League of Art Students and enrolled. He thought he might make money at this pursuit, butwhen the class was canceled—just a month after he entered—he took a life drawing class instead. (1) In 1918, while working for an insurance company at night, he studied at the School of the Art Society of Hartford. The following year, he won top honors in the portrait and life drawing classes. In 1920 Avery began spending summers in Gloucester, Massachusetts. There, in 1924, he met a young painter named Sally Michel. He followed her to New York, and in 1926 they were married. At the beginning of their marriage, Sally Avery determined to place her own artistic concerns second to those of her husband, and she worked as a freelance illustrator to free Avery from the need to support hisfamily.</P>
<P>Avery's early training had prepared him for a career as an academic painter. But he frequented the New York galleries thatexhibited modernist European art, including the Valentine Gallery, which held a retrospective of Matisse's work in 1927. By 1930, references to Matisse and Picasso can be discerned in Avery's paintings, and he began to introduce the simplified forms and flattened space that would, along with clear, unmodulated color, become the hallmarks of his later work. The 1930s were financially precarious times for the Averys. Avery exhibited his work frequently, but it didnot sell well. However, a 1935 invitation to join the prestigious Valentine Gallery, which exhibited Matisse, Picasso, Miró, Derain, Braque, Kandinsky, Stuart Davis, and others, had a vitalizing effect on his painting and his outlook.</P>
<P>Although Avery never joined any of the artists' organizations that proliferated in New York during the 1930s, the couple's apartment became a meeting ground for young painters. Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman were frequent visitors, and often joined the Averys during summers spent in Gloucester or southern Vermont. Many of Avery's paintings originated during these summers away from the city. A quiet man who seldom participated in conversations about him, Avery constantly sketched—landscapes, people, interiors—whatever was at hand. Around 1938, the Averys began organizing sketch classes where they and their friends shared the costs of a model. John Opper was among those who congregated at the Averys and remembered the lively talk and stimulating company.</P>
<P>In 1943, Avery joined the New York gallery of Paul Rosenberg, an important dealer who had been forced to flee Paris when the Nazis took the city. This affiliation, coupled with a retrospective exhibition at the Phillips Memorial Gallery in 1944, brought Avery national acclaim. Yet sales remained few, and New York museums, for the most part, showed little enthusiasm for his work. Avery persisted nonetheless, refining form and clarifying color. In 1946, the family spent three months in Mexico, where not only the landscape but the peasants and city streets offered new subject matter.Three years later Avery suffered a heart attack from which he never fully recovered. Prevented by his health from workingoutdoors, Avery began making monotypes, a medium that requires rapid execution. These monotypes affected his paintingstyle, and after about 1950, Avery increasingly eliminated extraneous detail from his work and began focusing on the harmony of the overall canvas rather than the interrelation of its parts. (2) Critical acclaim for Avery's work waned for several years during the early 1950s, eclipsed, perhaps, by Abstract Expressionism. Yet, by late in the decade, his independent vision, distilled, vibrant color, and acutely refined forms had secured his recognition as one of the most subtly powerful artists in mid-century America.</P>

Charles Noel Flagg, the school's director, persuaded Avery to transfer to a life-drawing class, which launched his career in fine arts. In 1918 Avery transferred to the School of Art at the Society of Hartford and exhibited his work while also holding down a variety of jobs, among them clerk and construction worker. In 1924 he became a member of the Connecticut Academy of Fine Arts and a year later moved to New Jersey.

In 1938 Avery worked as an artist in the Easel Division of the WPA Federal Art Project. About 1949, Avery began to experiment with monotypes. In 1952 he visited Europe and began working in woodcut. By 1957, his paintings had become much larger in scale.

This brought him into daily contact at the School of American Research with Indian painters Fred Kabotie (Hopi) and Ma-Pe-Wi (Zia) and artist William P. Henderson, who occupied studios there. By the thirties, after his work had appeared in major exhibitions of Indian art in Chicago and New York, Awa Tsireh enjoyed a national reputation. With India ink and a brilliant, distinctive palette, he produced decorative paintings of great precision. His style developed from a naive realism, used to depict genre and dance scenes, through more abstract phases featuring landscape "props" and stylized animal forms. Awa Tsireh had a profound influence on the work of many other artists, who were inspired by his wide range of subject matter, delicacy of draftmanship, color variations, and preservation of indigenous design elements.</P>

After his army service, Bacon traveled to Paris to study painting at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts. Unlike his peers, however, who returned to the states after an encounter with impressionism, Bacon remained abroad for the majority of his career, painting conservative historical genre scenes and pictures of the exotic Middle East. Dissimilar in subject matter, Bacon's paintings share a moralizing tone and a pervasive nostalgia for a primitive, pre-industrial past.

"226","Artist Biography","<p>"All that I would do I cannot&#151;that is, all I could say in art &#151;simply from lack of training, but with God's help I hope to deliver the message he entrusted to me."  George W. Whitaker, "Reminiscences of Providence Artists," <i>Providence Magazine, The Board of Trade Journal</i> (Feb. 1914): 139.</p><br /><p>Edward Mitchell Bannister's determination to become a successful artist was largely fueled by an inflammatory article he read in the <i>New York Herald</i> in 1867, that stated "the Negro seems to have an appreciation for art while being manifestly unable to produce it." Ironically, less than a decade later, in 1876, Bannister was the first African-American artist to receive a national award.</p><p>Bannister was born in November 1828 in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, Canada. His father was a native of Barbados, West Indies. The racial identity of Bannister's mother, Hannah Alexander Bannister, who lived in New Brunswick and whom Bannister credited with fostering his earliest artistic interests, is not known. Bannister's father apparently died early, and after the death of his mother in 1844 he lived with a white family in New Brunswick. Bannister left his foster home after several years and took a job at sea, as was customary for many young men from St. Andrews.</p><p>In 1848 Bannister moved to Boston where he held a variety of menial jobs before he became a barber and eventually learned to paint. Bannister painted in the Boston Studio Building, and also enrolled inseveral evening classes at Lowell Institute with the noted sculptor-anatomist Dr. William Rimmer.  Only a few of Bannister's paintings from the 1850s and 1860s have survived, preventing a stylistic assessment of his early period in Boston. While Bannister lived in Boston he must have seen and been influenced by the Barbizon School-inspired paintings of  William Morris Hunt who had studied in Europe and held numerous public exhibitions in Boston during the 1860s. American landscape painters were increasingly aware of the simple rustic motifs and pictorial poetry of French Barbizon paintings by Jean-Baptiste Corot, Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Millet, and Charles-Fran&#231;ois Daubigny in the midnineteenth century.</p><p>On June 10, 1857, Bannister marriedChristiana Cartreaux, a Narragansett Indian who was born in North Kingston, Rhode Island. The couple had no children. Christiana worked as a wigmaker and hairdresser in Boston, and her Rhode Island background might have prompted the Bannisters to move from Boston to Providence, Rhode Island, in 1870.</p><p>Since Bannister's artistic studies were limited, it is remarkable, indeed, that within five years after his arrival in Providence, one of Bannister's paintings was accepted in thePhiladelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. The painting, <i>Under the Oaks</i>, was selected for the first-prize bronze medal. Bannister related in considerable detail that the judges became indignant and originally wanted to "reconsider" the award upon discovering that Bannister was African American. The white competitors, however, upheld the decision and Bannister was awarded the bronze medal. The location of the painting has not been known since the turn of the century. </p><p>Following the Centennial Exposition, Bannister's reputation grew and numerous commissions enabled him to devote all his time to painting. He executed a large number of landscapes, most of which depict quiet, bucolic scenes rendered in somber tones and thick impasto. While Bannister'sinitial influence probably stemmed from the Barbizon-inspired works of William Morris Hunt, his paintings are reflective of an artist who loved the quiet beauties of nature and represented them in a realistic manner. Bannister's middle-period landscapes of the 1870s were generally executed in broad masses of heavy impasto with few details. They also evoke a tranquil mood that became one of the hallmarks of Bannister's style. Later landscapes of the 1880s and 1890s employed a more gentleimpasto and loosely applied broken color similar to impressionist techniques.</p><p>Many of Bannister's landscapes are small and have darkened considerably with age. His paintings contain no social or racial overtones, and the small figures seen frequently in his landscapes appear to be white. Although the majority of Bannister's paintings are landscapes, he also painted figure studies, religious scenes, seascapes, still lifes, and genre subjects. Bannister was attracted primarily to picturesque motifs including cottages, castles, cattle, dawns, sunsets, and small bodies of water, and he portrayed nature as a calm and submissive force in his works.</p><p>In spite of his limited training and experience, Bannister was among Providence's leading painters during the 1870s and 1880s. He was well liked and respected by his fellow citizens. On January 9, 1901, Bannister died while attending a prayer meeting at his church.  Shortly after his death, the Providence Art Club mounted a memorial exhibition of 101 of Bannister's paintings owned by Providence collectors. Bannister's grave in North Burial Ground, Providence, is marked by a rough granite boulder ten feet high bearing a carving of a palette with the artist's name and a pipe. A bronze plaque also adorns the monument and is inscribed with a poem, which reads in part, "This pure and lofty soul . . . who, while he portrayed nature, walked with God."  Edward M. Bannister was the only major African-American artist of the late nineteenth century who developed his talents without the benefit of European exposure.</p><p>Regenia A.

"241","Artist Biography","<p>A well-known daguerrean artist in Oswego, New York, George N. Barnard had opened a photography studio in Syracuse by 1854.  He subsequently became affiliated with Mathew Brady's gallery in Washington, D.C., and photographed Lincoln's inauguration in 1861.  As an official Union Army photographer during the Civil War, he was given two mules, a covered wagon, and an African-American driver to follow several military campaigns, most notably General William Tecumseh' Sherman's famous march in 1864 from Chattanooga to Atlanta.  His reminisces of General Sherman, Ulysses S. Grant, and Joseph Hooker made interesting reading for patrons of <i>Harper's Weekly, Leslie's,</i> and other contemporary periodicals and were illustrated by line engravings of his photographs.  Prompted by the success of Alexander Gardener's <i>Photographic Sketchbook of the War,</i> Barnard published <i>Photographic Views of Sherman's Campaign</i> in 1866.  Including sixty-one photographs, a small volume of historical text, and several official campaign maps, the album weighed twenty pounds and sold for one hundred dollars.</p><p>Barnard made at least three photographs of the area around New Hope, Georgia, after the week-long battle in May 1864 between General Joseph Johnston's southern forces and Sherman's troops.  He often focused on broken trees and ravaged ground, as well as other melancholy views, such as the Jones Memorial on the grounds of Bonaventure Plantation near Savannah.  Barnard's album presents a complex symbolic picture of the appalling looses suffered in this national conflict.</p><p>Merry A.

In the mid 1950s, he reduced his images to simple pictographs, although basic human shapes could still be discerned. Around 1960, however, he became dissatisfied with his attempts to unite human and abstract forms, and sought a fresh approach.

As an artist, writer, theater director, philanthropist, civic leader, and patron of the arts, Alice moved in the turn-of-the-century artistic circles of Paris, London, and Washington, D.C.</p><p>Throughout Alice's life, which often seemed a dramatic play of her own writing, she encoutered a brilliant cast of characters: among them Oscar Wilde, James McNeill Whistler, and the legendary explorer Henry Morton Stanley, whose impassioned offer of marriage she rejected.  Her easygoing personality and charming wit dazzled the artistic circles she traversed with such ease, winning the freindship of Anna Pavlova, Ara Bernhardt, Ruth St. Denis, and Emma Calv&eacute;, among many others.</p><p>Shortly after she turned nineteen, Alice accepted the marriage proposal of Gilded Age-industrialist Albert Clifford Barney.  Throughout their married life, Albert encouraged Alice to work at her social position rather than her artistic pursuits.  Her stubborn refusal to compromise her ideals infuriated him and led to continuous conflict.  They led separate lives for much of their marriage, Albert eventually drinking himself into an early grave, while Alice raised their two daughters, Natalie and Laura, and established her salon in Europe and the United States.</p><p>Alice began seriously painting during the Barneys' first trip to Paris in 1883, studing with Charles &Eacute;mile Auguste Carolus-Duran, a master portrait painter.  She continued painting on her return to the United States, winning accolates and a congressional commission, that shocked Washington society, who found it unseemly that a woman of wealth and social standing would paint at all.  She pursued the arts all her life, exhibiting a rare versatility between the fine arts and the performing arts.  After Albert's death, and during her subsequent marriage to Christian Hemmick, a man thirty years her junior, Alice devoted herself to the arts and converting Washington, D.C., from a cultural backwater to a true capital of the arts.</p><p>Among her other accomplishments, Alice designed and built what was considered an anomaly in her time, a studio house intended to provide a focus for the arts and artists of Washington, D.C.  The Studio House, as she called it, became the base for her manipulation of Washington culture.  However, foremost in Alice's intentions in building Studio House, was her desire to show others how to live artistically.  To this day, Studio House exists as one of the few extant examples of a turn-of-the-century artist's studio residence.</p><p>Jean L.

"291","Artist Biography","<p>During his childhood in Chicago, Illinois, Lester Beall's mother encouraged him to draw as a means of creative expression and as a diversion from their family's difficult financial situation. In 1917 Beall began attending Saturday art classes at the Art Institute of Chicago, where his youthful efforts received high praise. Beall continued to draw during high school, his course work including four years of mechanical drawing classes. This early grounding in technical drawing became an important element of his developing graphic style.</p><p>Beall enrolled at the University of Chicago as a science major, but ultimately switched to the art history program. Because the school offered no studio courses at that time, Beall supplemented his art history classes with additional life drawing and painting classes at the Art Institute. Upon graduation from the university in 1926, Beall found work as a freelance illustrator in Chicago. During the difficult years of the Depression, Beall continued to take studio art classes at the Art Institute. In addition to the classes, he spent a great deal of time at the museum's library, where he reveled in the avant garde graphic design of French art magazines. </p><p>Exposure to these very modern representations of art, typography, and illustration dramatically changed Beall's artistic vision.

In the decades after he began exhibiting, Beauchamp received several grants, traveled to Rome on a Fulbright fellowship (1959), and held several teaching positions.

"329","Artist Biography","<p>Running counter to the academic tradition prevalent in the United States in the early twentieth century, George Bellows and other realist painters began rendering the city life around them with candor and vitality. Bellows had terminated his college education in Columbus, Ohio, to move to New York in 1904 to study art.</p><p>Enrolled in the New York School of Art headed by William Merritt Chase, Bellows was a pupil of Robert Henri for about two years. One of the century's most influential art teachers, Henri was also the galvanizing force for the group of painters who became known as the Ashcan School because of their dark-toned depictions of city life, including its unsavory aspects. Although Bellows did not exhibit with the group in 1908, he was clearly in sympathy with the style and content of work by its members: Henri, John Sloan, William Glackens, George Luks, and Everett Shinn. Bellows displayed a particular gift for capturing the energy and movement of crowds on the street and at public events.</p><p>Much admired in academic circles, his work was included regularly in exhibitions organized by the National Academy of Design. His popularity was further enhanced by a series of paintings devoted to prizefights and boxing clubs in New York&mdash;activities closely followed by the athletically inclined artist. In 1913 Bellows achieved official recognition when he was elected a full academician by the National Academy of Design. Such honors meant little to Bellows, however. A tireless worker for the break with academic tradition, he helped to organize the Exhibition of Independent Artists in 1910 and the International Exhibition of Modern Art, more commonly referred to as the Armory Show, in 1913. A group of his oil paintings and drawings was included in the latter.</p><p>In 1916 Bellows began experimenting with lithography, then far less popular than etching among American artists and collectors. During the last nine years of his life, he produced a fine body of lithographs, such as <i>The Black Hat,</i> a 1921 portrait of his wife Emma, which is one of four prints by Bellows in the collection of the National Museum of American Art. His lithographs, often more satirical than his paintings, played an important role in renewing the American artist's use of the technique.</p><p>Although Bellows remains better known for his landscapes and views of bustling urban activities, he painted a substantial number of portraits. Whether these were inspired by people on the street or family members or commissioned, the artist took delight in recording the distinctive character of each of his subjects rather than idealizing them. Among his most appealing portraits are those of elderly sitters such as his mother and aunts, whom he painted while visiting the art colony of Woodstock, New York, where he built a house in 1922. In the autumn of 1924 Bellows painted the double portrait of his neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Phillip Wase.</p><p><i>National Museum of American Art</i> (CD-ROM) (New York and Washington D.C.: MacMillan Digital in cooperation with the National Museum of American Art, 1996)</p>",""

"339","Artist Biography","<p>One of the youngest members of the American Abstract Artists, Rosalind Bengelsdorf championed abstraction in her writings and lectures as well as in her paintings. As a teenager, she studied at the Art Students League (1930&ndash;34) with John Steuart Curry, Raphael Soyer, Anne Goldthwaite, and George Bridgman, and then for a year at the Annot School. In 1935, she entered Hans Hofmann's atelier as one of the many scholarship students he took on. The following year, she joined the abstract artists working on WPA murals under Burgoyne Diller's enlightened leadership.</p><p>In Hans Hofmann, Bengelsdorf found a true mentor. His dedication to the painting as an independent object matched her growing belief that the picture plane was a "living reality" of forms, energies, and colors. Like Hofmann, Bengelsdorf believed that "the shapes that compose the picture belong to nothing else but the picture."(1)</p><p>She had begun to analyze objects in terms of geometric form under George Bridgman at the league and subsequently at Annot. In a high school chemistry class, Bengelsdorf became fascinated with the idea that space is filled with "myriad,infinitesimal subdivisions." She saw "the universe as a charged miracle, a vibrating orchestration of the continuousinterplay of all forms of matter."(2) Under Hofmann, who emphasized theinterrelationship of objects and the environments they occupy, these impulses merged. For Bengelsdorf, the artist's task became the description of "not only what he sees but also what he knows of the natural internal function" of objects and the "laws of energy that govern all matter: the opposition, tension, interrelation, combination and destruction of planes in space."(3)  This meant that the abstract painter was studying the laws of nature, tearing it apart and then reorganizing the parts into a new creation.(4)</p><p>Despite this emphasis on formalism, Bengelsdorf also believed that abstractart played a larger function within society. She separated artistic concerns from economic ones and championed art's potential for increasing knowledge and understanding. Satire, motion pictures, posters, and other pictorial solutionsaddressed some kinds of human concerns; but the larger ones&#151;of the mind, of the possibility for order within life's experience&#151;these were the domain of abstraction.(5)</p><p>In her own paintings, such as<i>Abstraction</i> and<i>Seated Woman,</i> Bengelsdorfwas concerned with these questions.<i>Abstraction,</i> which relates to a WPA mural (now destroyed) Bengelsdorf painted for the Central Nurses Home on Welfare Island, balances simple geometric forms through position and color. <i>Seated Woman</i>, which was featured in the 1939 American Abstract Artists annual exhibition, owes a clear debt to Picasso's <i>Girl Before a Mirror</i> (1932, Museum of Modern Art) and gives clear evidence of her belief that "energy and form are inseparable."</p><p>After her marriage to Byron Browne in1940, and the birth of their son, Bengelsdorf turned from full-time painting to teaching, writing, and criticism.

"352","Artist Biography","<p>Frank Weston Benson was the son of a successful cotton merchant of Salem, Massachusetts and studied under Otto Grundman at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In 1883, Benson and fellow Bostonian Edmund Tarbell journeyed to Paris to continue their studies at the Acad&#233;mie Julian, an institution that attracted many young Americans.</p><p>On their return to Boston, Benson and Tarbell shared a studio and for many years both taught at the Museum School. There they mentored a host of young artists thereafter termed the Bostonians, a school whose work reflected the manners and mores of a community currently experiencing the Indian summer of its long cultural dominance. Faced with Irish Catholic ascendancy and waning economic influence, the Boston Brahmins waged a futile effort to sustain the authority of the WASP elite. The hopes, illusions, and apprehensions engendered by their decline were depicted in the paintings of the Bostonians. The genteel tradition was reaffirmed and the sanctity and grace of elite womankind were depicted on their canvases. Many of the Bostonians' paintings were touched by the light and dashing brushwork of Giverny. A few artists, including Benson and Tarbell, were much impacted by the recent 'rediscovery' of Vermeer, especially in their concern for spatial organization and the distribution of light.</p><p>Benson's most impressionistic work was done between 1895 and 1910. The sun-filled plein air paintings of his daughters in their gauzy summer frocks depict idealized young creatures in a carefree world.</p><p>In 1897, Benson, Tarbell, and fellow Bostonian Joseph de Camp left the increasingly conservative Society of American Painters and helped found the Ten American Painters. The Ten was a stylistically heterogeneous group, but all were to some degree touched by the impressionism of the age and moved to exhibit in a more intimate environment than the Salon system offered. They continued to exhibit together for more than twenty years, and eight of their number are represented in the current show.</p><p>After 1915, Benson began to devote much of his attention to printmaking. An avid sportsman, he created etchings of waterfowl and duck hunting which were influenced by the bold asymmetry of Japanese paints.</p><p><i>Still Life</i> is a late work (about 1926) strongly designed and richly painted.

"385","Artist Biography","<P>Best known as a sculptor and furniture designer, Harry Bertoia was born in San Lorenzo, Udine, Italy. In 1928 he began taking drawing classes in Italy before immigrating first to Canada, then to Detroit in 1930. He received a scholarship to the School of the Detroit Society of Arts and Crafts in 1936 and a year later was awarded a teaching scholarship at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. There he taught metalworking from 1937 to 1942 and then graphics for one year. In 1943 Bertoia moved to Los Angeles to work as a furniture designer. He also took welding classes at Santa Monica City College and in 1947 created his first welded sculptures. During this period Bertoia became an American citizen. His employer, Knoll Associates, introduced the Bertoia Collection of furniture in 1952. The following year he received his first commission for a large-scale sculpture for the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Bertoia subsequently resigned from Knoll Associates to concentrate on his sculpture. His distinguished work brought him other major commissions for the Massachussetts Institute of Technology Chapel, Lambert Airport in St. Louis, Dulles International Airport in Washington, D.C., and the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Virginia. Beginning in the 1940s, Bertoia exhibited extensively.

"414","Artist Biography","<p>"I learned a long time ago that self-dignity and racial pride could be consciously approached through art." &mdash; John Biggers, quoted in Elton Fax, <i>Seventeen Black Artists</i> (New York: Dodd, Mead and Company, 1971), 282.</p><br /><p>Born in Gastonia, North Carolina, on April 13, 1924, John Biggers was the last of seven children of Paul and Cora Biggers. Biggers' father was a teacher, school principal, and shoemaker; his mother was a homemaker. When John Biggers arrived on the campus of Virginia's Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in the fall of 1941 his goal was to become a plumber. During his freshman year at Hampton, however, Biggers enrolled in an art class taught by the dynamic educator Viktor Lowenfeld. It was a course that changed his life. Lowenfeld, an Austrian Jew who had moved to the United States to flee Nazi persecution, had gone to Hampton from Harvard University specifically to inspire young African-American students. In his intense instruction, Lowenfeld encouraged his students to explore the culture of their own people. He introduced his students to African sculpture as well as works by noted African-American artists, including Jacob Lawrence's widely acclaimed <i>Migration of the Negro</i> series. At Hampton, Biggers also studied under African-American painter Charles White and sculptor Elizabeth Catlett. These combined experiences awakened a desire in young Biggers to become an artist dedicated to depicting the lives of African-American people. While at Hampton Biggers also met his wife, Hazel, a fellow student whom he married in 1948.</p><p>When Viktor Lowenfeld left Hampton to assume a post in the art education department at Pennsylvania State University, he encouraged Biggers, his prot&#233;g&#322;, to follow. Biggers enrolled in Pennsylvania State University, where from 1946 to 1954 he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in art education as well as a doctorate. While there Biggers felt somewhat isolated during his early years on the predominantly white campus. During holidays and student teaching, however, Biggers had an opportunity to observe and portray urban tenement life among African Americans in Philadelphia.</p><p>In 1949 Biggers accepted a position to establish an art department at the newly created Texas State University for Negroes in Houston. Rising to the challenge, Biggers succeeded in inspiring hundreds of young students during his tenure at the school, which was later named Texas Southern University. While working full-time as a teacher and administrator at Texas Southern, Biggers began establishing his reputation as a major African-American artist of the Southwest. One of his earliest large commissions in Texas was a set of illustrations to accompany a book entitled <i>Aunt Dicey Tales</i> by African-American Texan folklorist, J. Mason Brewer. From 1950 to 1956 Biggers painted four murals in African-American communities in Texas, which was the beginning of his interest in this category of painting. Each a major effort, the murals represented for Biggers the broadest methods of making his art accessible to the entire community. Since that time, Biggers has completed many other notable murals in the South and Southwest.</p><p>Unlike many African-American artists who made pilgrimages to Paris and other European cities to study, Biggers decided early in his career to visit the land of his ancestors. He made his first trip to West Africa in 1957 through a travel fellowship from UNESCO. His time was spent primarily in Ghana, Togo, Dahomey (now the Republic of Benin), and Nigeria where he was mesmerized by the colorful culture and life of African peoples. Biggers worked feverishly during his initial six-month stay, and produced an enormous body of drawings, paintings, and photographs. An important product of Biggers' African journey was the publication of a book, <i>Ananse, Web of Life in Africa,</i> in 1962. This book of drawings and writing records Biggers' African experience, and was one of the first books to be published by an African-American artist to reflect in narrative and visual terms the writer's kinship with the land of his ancestors.</p><p>Between 1969 and 1974 Biggers was severely ill and painted very little. Frustrated and in poor health, Biggers spent the majority of his time reflecting on his past experiences. In 1974 Biggers attended the exhibition, <i>African Art of the Dogon,</i> at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, which reawakened his creative talents. He began creating new works that were more abstract, emphasizing the basic and eliminating theincidental. He began assembling his large and impressive collection of African art and surrounded himself with tools and crafts of African Americans, family quilts, and gourds&mdash;symbols that appear in Biggers' current works, as do anvils, cooking pots, washboards, and geometric quilt designs, reminiscent of Biggers' early years in North Carolina. Biggers has also developed a series of paintings depicting the characteristic  "shotgun houses" of the Carolinas. Equally talented as a draftsman, lithographer, panel painter, and muralist, Biggers has been devoted to the portrayal of African-American culture in his work.</p><p>Following his retirement from Texas Southern University in 1983, Biggers entered a new phase of creative energy. Today, his career has come full-circle. In 1990 Biggers returned to his roots at Hampton University as artist-in-residence. There he served as model, mentor, and a source of inspiration for Hampton's students, and instilled in his students some of the same principles he gained there many years before. Recently, Biggers moved to his hometown of Gastonia, North Carolina, to live and work.</p><b>Shotgun, Third Ward #1</b><p><i>Shotgun, Third Ward</i>depicts a scene from Houston's predominantly African-American Third Ward community where Biggers lived. Houston's Third Ward is an important historical black community still vital today. Painted shortly after almost five years of the artist's recuperation, the work is a fine example of Biggers' commitment to portraying African-American neighborhood scenes. <i>Shotgun, Third Ward</i> is a pivotal painting in the artist's career, as it is one of his earliest to employ three motifs that became ubiquitous symbols in his later works: the wheel, shotgun houses, and a lighted candle.</p><p>Regenia A.

"431","Artist Biography","<P>Along with Raymond Jonson, Emil Bisttram is one of the best-known members of the Transcendental Painting Group of New Mexico. A native of Hungary, Bisttram came to the United States when he was eleven. In New York, he set up a commercial art business and tooknight classes with Leon Kroll, JayHambidge, and Howard Giles at the National Academy of Design, the Cooper Union, Parsons School of Design, and the Art Students League. After completing his studies, Bisttram joined the faculty at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts where he taught the principles of dynamic symmetry developed by Hambidge. He subsequently taught for five years at the Master Institute of the Roerich Museum in New York, and in 1931, supported by a Guggenheim Fellowship, went to Mexico to study fresco painting with Diego Rivera.(1)</P>
<P>Bisttram first visited New Mexico in 1930, but was "frustrated by the grandeur of the scenery and the limitless space."(2) Yet in 1932 he returned and settled in Taos, where he founded the Taos School of Art. Bisttram's paintings of the early 1930s reflect his all-consuming commitment to the New Mexico environment. Highly stylized canvases depict Hopi snake dancers, portraits of Indian and Mexican-American women, and the distinctive architectural style of Southwest churches. By the mid 1930s, he was actively engaged in mural projects for public buildings in New Mexico, Washington, D.C., and other cities under the sponsorship of Franklin D. Roosevelt's various New Deal programs. From a rather conventional, representational style of the 1920s, during the mid 1930s Bisttram moved toward nonobjectivity. Yet he continued to paint more traditional work. For example, his mural for the U.S. Department of Justice, commissioned in 1936, is an allegorical composition contrasting the life of modern women with that of "Old World" women.</P>
<P>In 1938, Bisttram founded, withRaymond Jonson, the Transcendental Painting Group, an organization devoted to nonobjective painting that aspired toenhance the spiritual level of society. For Bisttram, who was a Theosophist, theTranscendental Painting Group formalized ideas he had held for many years. Like his New York contemporaries who were centered around Hilla Rebay and the Guggenheim, Bisttram sought a new art for a new world order, and he wrote of universalism and "the essential Oneness of all things" as replacing the mechanistic, dualistic concepts of the past.(3) He spoke out against abstract art as a means of producing simple aesthetic emotion through the psychological impact of pure form and color. Instead, he argued that artists should stimulate deeper ideas and intuitions and thereby make a "significant contribution to the development of our culture and the advance of civilization."(4)</P>
<P>In his paintings of the late 1930s and beyond, Bisttram explored these concepts and gave titles, such as <I>Upward</I> (ca.1940), and <I>The Oversoul,</I> that indicated the spiritual understandings he intended.</P>
<P>Throughout his life, Bisttram actively contributed to the artistic development of New Mexico. He continued to draw inspiration from legends and visual motifs native to the Southwest but couched them in the nonobjective, transcendental terms he had evolved during the late 1930s.</P>

"457","Artist Biography","<p>Bloom and his parents immigrated to Boston from Brunoviski, Lithuania, following World War I. Bloom was a precocious draughtsman and, while still in high school, began studies with Harold Zimmerman at the West End Community Center where he met lifelong friend Jack Levine. Denman Ross, a color theorist and Harvard professor emeritus, took the young artists under his wing, rented a studio for them and provided small weekly allowances. During the 1930s, through intermittent employment on the WPA and support from several dealers, Bloom avoided the confines of a full-time job and, along with Levine and German-born Karl Zerbe, became known as a Boston Expressionist. Bloom is at heart a mystic and philosopher, a private individual intrigued by ideas of reincarnation, Jewish tradition, Eastern philosophy, and the occult. In his paintings, and in the drawings that occupied him primarily from the 1950s until the late 1970s, Bloom deals with themes of life and death and with human emotional conflict.</p><p>Virginia M.

"463","Artist Biography","<p>A native of Cincinnati, Blum studied drawing with Frank Duveneck while still a youth. At the age of sixteen, he was first exposed to Japanese art and crafts, an interest that remained with him throughout his life. Another major influence on his work was the popular Spanish genre painter Mariano Fortuny, whose brilliant colors and dashing brushwork had great appeal for him. Among Blum's associates he was playfully called "Blumtuny."</p><p>In 1879, Blum joined his friend William Merritt Chase in Venice. During his two-year stay he was neighbor to James McNeill Whistler, who instructed Blum in the principles of Japanese design and also encouraged his use of pastels, a medium that Whistler was then using with extraordinary results. Blum later observed, "I know [Whistler] well. He is a very nice man," an opinion not widely shared at the time.</p><p>Pastel indeed was a medium well suited to the suggestiveness and rapid notation of Blum's technique. Blum and his good friend Chase became the preeminent exponents of pastel technique in America, and together they founded the Society of Painters in Pastels, an organization that was instrumental in hastening acceptance of the impressionist aesthetic on these shores. Oscar Wilde, a great admirer of Blum's work, told him, "your exquisite pastels give me the sensation of eating yellow satin."</p><p>While living in Venice, Blum sought out subject matter in the less frequented quarters of the city. <i>Venetian Lace Makers</i> (1887), his first important canvas, painted in Burano, won him several medals and an associate membership in the National Academy of Design. With loose brushwork, a dark palette, and dramatic contrasts, the canvas depicts two young women deeply concentrating on their demanding task.</p><p>Years later, a professional commission at last took him to Japan, "the most glorious experience I have ever had," he reported. Not long after, at the age of forty-six, Blum died of pneumonia, his promising career ended.</p><p>Emery Battis Artist Biographies for the exhibition <i>American Impressionism: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum</i> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2000)</p>",""

Following brief jobs with a jewelry firm and a lithographic and engraving company, he struck out on his own in 1924, although he did agree to paint several post office murals for the government during the 1930s. Blume's mature career stemmed from his figurative paintings of the late 1920s, and national recognition came in the 1930s with his anti-Fascist work, <i>The Eternal City.</i> Although often called a Magic Realist, Blume took his imagery not from the domain of fantasy but from a world of familiar objects and landscape features forced into surreal relationships.

He had just moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from East Liverpool, Ohio, his hometown, to which he had returned but two years earlier after several years of wandering in the Midwest insearch of a place where he might peacefully settle. His need for a haven was acute, for in the years between 1850 and 1852 he had been buffeted by the deaths of his wife and father, and the dismal failure of an ambitious moving panorama on which he had staked both his financial security and his professional reputation. Embittered by his losses and by what he felt was pervasive social and political corruption, Blythe had by 1856 begun to turn away from the portraiture on which he had survived for the previous sixteen years, and had started instead to focus on images that satirized the folly and turpitude of mankind. </p><p>The Pittsburgh to which he turned was not a haven, but instead a place of social turmoil, economically depressed yet crowded with immigrants whose poverty and ignorance were ripe targets for manipulation and abuse. Crime, from petty truancy to murder and arson, was increasing rapidly, and while social and educational reforms were being debated from both pulpitand council chamber, scores of neglected children continued to roam the streets. </p><p>In the larger national picture, it was a time of complex political ferment. New alliances were being formed, like the Know-Nothings, who were declaratively anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic; the Republican Party, from which Abraham Lincoln was soon to emerge, held its first convention in Pittsburgh in 1856, and had already begun to address those impassioned issues that would lead the country into a devastating internal conflict.</p><p>It was thus that in Pittsburgh, in which population growth exceeded opportunities foremployment, even though booming industry still covered the city with an impenetrable andchoking cloud of soot, Blythe found an inexhaustible source of material for his sardonic wit. Other artists who were his contemporaries could prosper in their endless variations on reassuring themes; Blythe's acute sense of human error and depravity revealed a very different picture ofAmerican civilization on the eve of the Civil War.</p><p>Bruce W.

"489","Artist Biography","<P>Ilya Bolotowsky was not only a founding member of the American Abstract Artists, but also one of the forces behind its programs and exhibitions. A Russian immigrant to New York in 1923, Bolotowsky studied at the National Academy of Design between 1924 and 1930. He then worked for several years as a textile designer and taught art in settlement houses. By 1932, he had saved enough money so that, combined with a small scholarship, he was able to spend ten months in Europe, primarily Italy, Germany, Denmark, and England, with a few weeks in Paris. When he left for Europe, Bolotowsky was already familiar with Picasso, Matisse, other avant-garde Parisian painters, and Russian Constructivists. He appreciated Cubism because it shattered naturalism.(1) Yet, his work in Europe was more akin to the Expressionism of Chaim Soutine, which he knew through his friend William H. Johnson, another Soutine aficionado.(2)</P>
<P>Bolotowsky again did textile designing on his return to New York. In 1934, he worked for the Public Works of Art Project, a pilot program of federal support that paved the way for the WPA-FAP in 1935. When Gertrude Greene mentioned that Burgoyne Diller was heading up a WPA mural project that would use abstract artists, Bolotowsky submitted sketches. Diller arranged Bolotowsky's transfer from the WPA teaching project, and Bolotowsky set to work on a mural design for the Williamsburg Housing Project, whose architect, William Lescaze, was sympathetic to abstraction.</P>
<P>In his abstract compositions of the mid 1930s, Bolotowsky gave free rein to a variety of stylistic approaches. He encountered the work of both Miró and Mondrian in 1933, and by 1936 introduced a Mondrianesque grid pattern as the framework for playful biomorphic forms and rectangular planes of unmodulated color. His flirtation with Miró is apparent in the lyric dancing of simple geometric shapes, organic forms, and thin, directional lines over the surface of a mural study he completed for the Hall of Medical Science in the Health Building at the 1939 New York World's Fair.</P>
<P>During World War II, Bolotowsky served in the Army Air Corps. After his discharge, he replaced Josef Albers for two years at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. From 1948 to 1957 he taught at the University of Wyoming and at Brooklyn College; from 1957 to 1965 he was Professor of Art at State Teacher's College in New Paltz, New York, and from 1965 until 1971 he taught at the University of Wisconsin in Whitewater. At various times he also held short-term or adjunct positions at Hunter College in New York, the University of New Mexico, and Queens College.</P>
<P>During the 1940s, Bolotowsky began looking more closely at the purist geometries of his friends Burgoyne Diller and Albert Swinden, and especially at Mondrian's Neo-plastic paintings. His own work underwent a purification of bothform and color.(3) He did not immediately reduce his palette to the primary colors, as well as black and white, as did the Dutch painter, nor did he focus exclusively on rectangular geometric configurations. In paintings such as <I>Architectural Variation</I> of 1949, Bolotowsky exorcised all suggestions of illusionistic space. He described his work during the forties in terms of surface tensions:</P>
<P>"In the early forties I still used diagonals. A diagonal, of course, creates ambivalent depth diagonal depth might go either back or forth. It's not like perspective which goes only one way. … I had to give up diagonals because the space going back and forth was becoming too violent. The diagonal space was getting in the way of the tension on the flat surface. You cannot get an absolute flatness in painting because of the interplay of the colors, the way they feel to us. But you can achieve relative flatness, within which the colors and the proportions might push back and forth creating an extra tension. This tense flatness must not destroy the overall flat tension, which, to my mind, in two-dimensional painting is the most important thing."(4)</P>
<P>In Wyoming, Bolotowsky began making experimental films, usually based on either Greek myths or myths Bolotowsky fabricated. His films used actors and were not abstract. Bolotowsky believed that film was an art of empathy and that abstraction represented a conceptual approach more appropriately conveyed through painting and sculpture.(5)</P>
<P>Before the war, Bolotowsky had exhibited in a variety of group exhibitions, including the Museum of Modern Art's New Horizons in American Art in 1936 and in both the second and third annual shows of The Ten (1936 and 1937). In 1946, after his return, his paintings began to receive wide attention. He had solo exhibitions at J.B. Neumann's New Art Circle and at The Pinacotheca gallery, and in 1954, he joined Grace Borgenicht's gallery, where he showed biennially into the 1970s.</P><BR><BR>

"532","Artist Biography","<p>A native of California, Harry Bowden began his art studies at the Los Angeles Art Institute and later worked in commercial advertising. Between 1928 and 1931, Bowden divided his time between the National Academy of Design, the Art Students League in New York, and the Chouinard School of Art in Los Angeles. He soon became dissatisfied with academic training: "It made art too much of a craft. You win a prize and pretty soon you have a home in the country and it becomes a routine business."(1) In 1931, after a summer class with Hans Hofmann at the University of California at Berkeley, Bowden determined to pursue painting seriously. He made his way to New York working as a petty officer on a merchant ship. By 1934, he was again studying with Hofmann. The following year he became one of Hofmann's assistants and was friendly with George McNeil, Albert Swinden, Wilfrid Zogbaum, Ad Reinhardt, and Willem de Kooning. In 1937 and 1938, he painted two murals for the Williamsburg Housing Project.</p><p>Bowden's New York work prior to 1940 reflects his fascination with a broad range of abstract themes, some of which, like <i>Untitled: Nude,</i> have a figurative basis, while others, as <i>Number 47 (Untitled Abstraction),</i> avoid reference to recognizable elements. Throughout his work from these years, however, runs evidence of Hofmann's teachings and an abiding interest in Cubism.(2)  The unsigned catalogue statement for the 1940 exhibition of Bowden, McNeil, and Swinden at the New School for Social Research stresses the significance of abstract concepts, whether or not recognizable objects appeared in their work: "In each [work] an idea has been adapted to the elements of painting. . . ." Pure nonobjectivity, like pure representation, was sterile ground: "An artist who only portrays a geometric arrangement of colored forms he has in mind, contributes nothing more than the artist who tries to copy nature. They show us the possibilities of a painting, but do not fulfill the promise. . . . A painting embraces many ideas, symbols, forms, tones, and colors, but all are resolved into a new thing. The metamorphosis makes the painting real&#151;gives it a life of its own."(3)</p><p>In New York, Bowden achieved recognition through exhibitions of his paintings at the non-profit Artists' Gallery (1938&ndash;46), the Egan Gallery, the Reinhardt Gallery, and the New School for Social Research. His fashion and commercial photography was also well received.(4)</p><p>In 1942, after the United States entered World War II, Bowden returned to California to become a shipfitter. Although he continued to show in New York, and periodically visited there, Sausalito became his permanent home. Following the war, photography again became an important part of his life. From the mid 1950s until his premature death of a heart attack in 1965, he concentrated, in both photography and painting, on the figure. An admirer of Edward Weston, of whom he made an unfinished film called <i>Wildcat Hill Revisited,</i> perhaps Bowden remains best known for photographs of sensual female nudes inlandscape settings and portraits of jazzmusicians, writers, and other painters.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

Although never a Cubist, Bowden'sideas about abstract art are colored by his appreciation for Cubism. His notebooks are sprinkled with quotations by Juan Gris, Georges Braque, Picasso, and others. Firsthand contact with Fernand L&#233;ger, whom he (along with McNeil, de Kooning, and others) assisted on an unrealized mural project for the French Line terminal in New York in 1936, further cemented his commitment to abstraction based on objects, although he continued to do nonobjective work occasionally over the next several years.</p><p>3.

"621","Artist Biography","<P>Byron Browne was a central figure in many of the artistic and political groups that flourished during the 1930s. He was an early member of the Artists' Union, a founding member of the American Abstract Artists, and participated in the Artists' Congress until 1940 when political infighting prompted Browne and others to form the break-away Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. Browne's artistic training followed traditional lines. From 1925 to 1928, he studied at the National Academy of Design, where in his last year he won the prestigious Third Hallgarten Prize for a still-life composition. Yet before finishing his studies, Browne discovered the newly established Gallery of Living Art. There and through his friends John Graham and Arshile Gorky, he became fascinated with Picasso, Braque, Miró, and other modern masters.</P>
<P>The mid 1930s were difficult financially for Browne.(1) His work was exhibited in a number of shows, but sales were few. Relief came when Burgoyne Diller began championing abstraction within the WPA's mural division. Browne completed abstract works for Studio D at radio station WNYC, the U.S. Passport Office in Rockefeller Center, the Chronic Disease Hospital, the Williamsburg Housing Project, and the 1939 World's Fair.(2)</P>
<P>Although Browne destroyed his early academic work shortly after leaving the National Academy, he remained steadfast in his commitment to the value of tradition, and especially to the work of Ingres.(3) Browne believed, with his friend Gorky, that every artist has to have tradition. Without tradition art is no good. Having a tradition enables you to tackle new problems with authority, with solid footing.(4)"</P>
<P>Browne's stylistic excursions took many paths during the 1930s. His WNYC mural reflects the hard-edged Neo-plastic ideas of Diller, although a rougher Expressionism better suited his fascination for the primitive, mythical, and organic. A signer, with Harari and others, of the 1937 Art Front letter, which insisted that abstract art forms "are not separated from life," Browne admitted nature to his art—whether as an abstracted still life, a fully nonobjective canvas built from colors seen in nature, or in portraits and figure drawings executed with immaculate, Ingres-like finesse.(5) He advocated nature as the foundation for all art and had little use for the spiritual and mystical arguments promoted by Hilla Rebay at the Guggenheim Collection: When I hear the words non-objective, intra-subjective, avant-garde and such trivialities, I run. There is only visible nature, visible to the eye or, visible by mechanical means, the telescope, microscope, etc."(6)</P>
<P>Increasingly in the 1940s, Browne adopted an energetic, gestural style. Painterly brushstrokes and roughly textured surfaces amplify the primordial undercurrents posed by his symbolic and mythical themes. In 1945, Browne showed with Adolph Gottlieb, William Baziotes, David Hare, Hans Hofmann, Carl Holty, Romare Bearden, and Robert Motherwell at the newly opened Samuel Kootz Gallery. When Kootz suspended business for a year in 1948, Browne began showing at Grand Central Galleries. In 1950, he joined the faculty of the Art Students League, and in 1959 he began teaching advanced painting at New York University.</P>
<P>1. When she met him in October 1934, Rosalind Bengelsdorf Browne recalled that her future husband's daily diet consisted of a quart of milk, a box of cornmeal, a head of lettuce, and some raisins. See Rosalind Bengelsdorf Browne Papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>2. Browne was also involved with Léger's mural project for the French Line terminal building that was canceled after officials discovered Léger's communist sympathies. See Rosalind Bengelsdorf Browne Papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>3. The abstract quality of Ingres's work held special appeal not only for Browne, but for John Graham and Arshile Gorky. Rosalind Bengelsdorf Browne remembered Gorky waving an Ingres reproduction around at the opening of the first American Abstract Artists annual exhibition and proclaiming that the French master was more "abstract" than all the work in the exhibition. See Rosalind Bengelsdorf Browne Papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>4. Gorky is quoted in Melvin P. Lader, "Graham, Gorky, de Kooning and the "Ingres Revival" in America," <I>Arts Magazine</I> 52, no. 7 (March 1978): 99.</P>
<P>5. The classical drawings, a group of which was exhibited at Washburn Gallery in 1977, show heads (often of cross-eyed women) and classically garbed and garlanded seated figures. They have important stylistic parallels to John Graham's paintings and drawings of the period. </P>
<P>6. Quoted in Gail Levin, "Byron Browne in the Context of Abstract Expressionism," <I>Arts Magazine</I> 59, no. 10 (Summer 1985): 129. Browne's notebook is in the collection of his son Stephen B.

Through EAT (Experiments in Art and Technology), Burson began a collaboration with Tom Schneider and David Petty, computer engineers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to create an aging machine, or more specifically The Method and Apparatus for Producing an Image of a Person's Face at a Different Age, for which she received a patent in 1981. She also collaborated with Cambridge computer scientists Richard Carling and David Kramlich (whom she later married) on further development of the process in 1982. Burson utilized the technology to create provocative portraits; these composite images of the major races, world leaders, and movie stars earned significant attention when they first appeared in the early 1980s. Perhaps the most humanistic application of her work has been in the location of missing children; her updated portraits have been used to reunite children with their families. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Burson's work grew to incorporate more primitive media, including dauguerreotypes and images made with simple plastic commercial cameras. The results, though less sophisticated technologically, are of a highly personal nature that examine such subjects as birth defects and the horrors of disease.</p><p><i>National Museum of American Art</i> (CD-ROM) (New York and Washington D.C.: MacMillan Digital in cooperation with the National Museum of American Art, 1996)</p>",""

"753","Artist Biography","<p>"You may know your  business, but no one else will, if you don't  advertise." Miles Carpenter's successful lumber and ice business, active after 1912, needed little promotion, and his first small carvings of animals and figures, made during the early 1940s, were essentially pastimes. After retiring in 1955, the industrious Carpenter opened a roadside store offering ice, soda pop, and vegetables. In 1960 he began carving trade signs for the new business. After his wife's death in 1966,Carpenter devoted himself to a third career&#8212;carving sculptures. Many he called "advertisements"; others were benevolent interpretations of contemporary history and human nature. Still others were meant to entertain children and adults alike, and some were decorative pieces. All reflect his astute grasp of an audience, his unerring ability to extract forms from wood, and his delight in tinkering with materials at hand.</p><p>After 1966 Carpenter carved figures and animals that he displayed in the flatbed of his pickup truck, which he strategically parked next to his roadside stand or drove throughthe community. <i>Indian Woman</i> [SAAM 1986.65.235] was one of the first "advertisements."  Although her wardrobe changed over the years, she has always worn the clothing of Carpenter's late wife. A male Indian figure and a boy were among her companions in the truck and, locally, the trio was considered a portrait of Carpenter's family. &#133; Carpenter was discovered by the  contemporary art world in 1972. As carvings in the truck sold, he substituted new works, often the watermelon slices, "monkey dogs," "root monsters," and small farm animals that became the staple of Carpenter's repertoire.</p><p>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan <i>Made with Passion: The Hemphill Folk Art Collection in the National Museum of American Art</i> (Washington, D.C. and London: National Museum of American Art with the Smithsonian Institution Press, 1990)</p>",""

"770","Artist Biography","<p>Mary Cassatt was born near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The family soon settled in Philadelphia but traveled extensively through Europe during Mary's childhood. Her father was a prominent investment banker and her brother, Alexander, became president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. </p><p>At fifteen, she was admitted to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and four years later moved to Paris where she studied briefly with Jean-L&#233;on G&#233;r&#244;me, but chiefly educated herself by copying at the Louvre. In 1872, already under the artistic influence of Courbet and Manet, she established a studio in Spain, studied the work of Vel&#225;zquez and Ribera, and produced a series of paintings of local subjects with strongly modeled features placed against dark backgrounds.</p> <p>In the Salon of 1874, Edgar Degas saw a painting of Cassatt's which prompted him to exclaim, "Voila! There is someone who feels as I do." That same year, Cassatt noticed several Degas pastels in a shop window and wrote, "It changed my life! I saw art then as I wanted to see it." Soon thereafter they met, beginning a friendship and artistic relationship that would last forty years.</p><p>Degas introduced her to other members of the emergent impressionist fraternity, and for nine years, as the only American, she continued to exhibit with them and help organize their shows. She always found their company congenial and stimulating, and as her most recent biographer points out, "for the first time Cassatt found people whose biting, critical, opinionated attitudes matched her own."</p><p>It is noteworthy that both Cassatt and Degas preferred to call themselves "Independents" rather then "Impressionists"; both always insisted on the integrity of form in their painting, whereas Monet, Pissaro, and others tended to dissolve form into light. Like them, she initially employed a high-keyed palette applied in small touches of contrasting colors. However, over time, Cassatt's style became less painterly, the forms more solidly monumental and placed within clear linear contours.</p><p>As a woman in nineteenth-century Paris, she lacked opportunity to depict the diverse subject matter available to her male colleagues: caf&#233;s, clubs, bordellos, and even the streets were not comfortably accessible to genteel ladies. The domestic realm, with occasional forays into the theater, became her field of activity. Women and children and family members were generally the subjects of her work, and she became chiefly known for her depictions of mothers and small children. In these "Madonna" paintings she sought to avoid anecdotalism and sentimentality, overcoming the limitations of her subject matter by endowing it with firm structural authority and subtle color interest.</p><p>In later years, her eyesight failing, she turned increasingly to pastels, as Degas had done under pressure of the same condition. Like Degas, she became a preeminent exponent of that difficult medium.</p><p>In 1872, Cassatt formed a close friendship with a young American in Paris, Louisine Elder, soon to become the wife of H. O. Havemeyer, the reigning "sugar baron" of the American Gilded Age. A woman of discriminating taste and formidable wealth, Louisine turned to her artist friend for guidance in assembling a collection of paintings. In time, they amassed a comprehensive array of impressionist work. Much of the collection was donated to American museums and contributed significantly toward the shaping of public taste and general acceptance of what has since become the most popular of all painting styles.</p><p>Emery Battis Artist Biographies for the exhibition <i>American Impressionism: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum</i> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2000)</p>",""

Catlett's sculptures and prints are well known in the United States and Mexico, where she taught sculpture at Mexico's National University for many years. Catlett was born in 1915 in a comfortable middle-class neighborhood in Washington, D.C. She attended public schools in the nation's capital and enrolled in the art department at Howard University, where she graduated with honors in 1936.</p><p>The desire for further study motivated Catlett to seek admittance to graduate school at the University of Iowa, where she studied with Grant Wood and emigr&eacute; sculptor Ossip Zadkine. Catlett was the first student to complete the requirements for the University of Iowa's Master of Fine Arts degree in 1940. That same year, Catlett received the "first honor" in sculpture at the American Negro Exposition in Chicago.</p><p>In 1941 Catlett married Charles White, a fellow artist from Chicago with whom she had exhibited in a number of shows. During the same year, White received a Rosenwald Fellowship to travel and study in the South and to make sketches for a proposed mural at Hampton Institute (now Hampton University). Catlett accompanied her husband and experienced directly the racism of the time. She subsequently vowed to dedicate her art to black awareness. While Catlett and her husband were traveling in the South, Catlett taught art at Dillard University in Louisiana, Prairie View College in Texas, and at Hampton Institute with Viktor Lowenfeld. In 1942, White and Catlett returned to New York and studied at the Art Students League.</p><p>During the early 1940s Catlett produced a number of sculptures depicting mother and child themes. These works were executed in a simple realistic style and shared a similar quiet strength with Catlett's works from her graduate school years. During the next decade Catlett's style moved toward abstraction, defined by smoothly rounded forms and gracefully elongated figures.</p><p>In 1946 Catlett received a Rosenwald Fellowship, and accompanied her husband to Mexico City where they studied painting, sculpture, and lithography. They became acquainted with the Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, and lived in his house briefly. In 1947 Catlett and Charles White divorced and Catlett remained in Mexico City where she worked and developed a sense of identity with the city's residents. She began working with some of Mexico's most distinguished printmakers, and married the painter-engraver Francisco Mora. Elizabeth Catlett-Mora later became a naturalized citizen of Mexico. Today, she is regarded as one of Mexico's most celebrated artists. Though she has found warm acceptance in her adopted country, her African-American consciousness has inspired her to continue to produce sculptures and prints that deal with the struggles of African Americans.</p><p>Regenia A.

"782","Artist Biography","<p>"If my life be spared, nothing shall stop me from visiting every nation of Indians on the Continent of North America." With these words George Catlin staked his artistic claim.  He was the first great painter to travel beyond the Mississippi to paint the Indians, and his Indian Gallery, staggering in its ambition and scope, is one of the wonders of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Catlin was just seven years old in 1803 when Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a three-year expedition to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase. In 1830, Catlin made his initial pilgrimage to St. Louis to meet William Clark and learn from him all he could of the western lands he hoped to visit. He would have only a short time to accomplish his goal&#8212;to capture with canvas and paint the essence of Indian life and culture.  In that same year, the Indian Removal Act commenced the twelve-year action that would remove the remaining Indians from land east of the Mississippi.  Within a few years, the Mandan would be decimated by smallpox; with in a few decades, the number of buffalo would drop from millions to a few thousand, and the high prairies would be crosshatched by the plow and the railroad.</p><p>When he undertook his first journey, George Catlin turned his back on a first career as a Philadelphia lawyer and a second as a miniaturist. In 1832 he traveled more than 1800 miles up the Missouri  River from St. Louis.  By the decade's end, he had painted more than 500 portraits, scenes, and landscapes and accumulated an astonishing collection of Indian artifacts. He had exhibited his collection in major American cities, and in 1839 he crossed the Atlantic to display his Indian Gallery in London and eventually Paris and Brussels as well.</p><p>Not merely a painter, Catlin also considered himself a scientist, explorer, author, and entrepreneur. While touring with his Gallery, he fell so deeply into debt that he lost almost the entire collection.  His compulsion to continue was so strong he re-created more than 400 paintings and undertook further travels to paint 200 additional images covering North and South America.  He believed that his Indian Gallery was a national treasure, worthy of preservation by the United States government. Though he did not live to see his wish fulfilled, the original Indian Gallery came to the Smithsonian seven years after his death in 1872.</p><p>Brian W.

"786","Artist Biography","<P>When he was sixteen, Cavallon immigrated to the United States from Sorio, a small town in the province of Vicenza, Italy. He worked for several years in a factory in Massachusetts while studying art privately, and in 1926, he went to New York.(1) During night sessions at the National Academy of Design, Cavallon took the antique class and worked from casts. After five years at the academy, he left his daytime work as a carpenter and began full-time study for six months. There he met Ilya Bolotowsky, Lee Krasner, Byron Browne, and others. He spent two summers in Provincetown studying with Charles Hawthorne, who taught him to put aside drawing and instead work directly with color. Although Cavallon's painting at this point was still relatively conventional, he already thought of himself as "modern" and began to speak out against the academy's curriculum.</P>
<P>Despite this, Cavallon had become an accomplished painter under the academy's tutelage. In 1929, he received a Louis Comfort Tiffany fellowship that provided living quarters and studio space at the Tiffany estate at Oyster Bay, New York, for a summer. When the Depression struck, Cavallon returned to Italy where he remained for three years. Back in New York in 1933, he studied drawing with Hans Hofmann in exchange for carpentry work. During the summers he returned with Hofmann's class to Provincetown. Among the Hofmann group, he became especially friendly with George McNeil, Harry Bowden, and Albert Swinden. Although he did not yet profess to fully understand abstract art, Cavallon began looking at Picasso, Braque, and JeanHélion. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Cavallon found little inspiration in Picasso; instead he admiredthe structural solidity of Céanne and Hélion. Although in 1935 Cavallon exhibited landscapes done in Italy, he soon moved toward abstraction, initially working from still-life compositions that showed evidence of Céanne's influence. Once determined to put subject matter aside altogether, he moved quickly toward the freely brushed geometric phrasing apparent in <I>Country Scene</I> of 1938. In his paintings of the late 1930s, Cavallon often employed a loose grid structure, which led critics to suggest an interest in Mondrian; yet Cavallon was more concerned with light and evocations of landscape than with the strict formal structure of the Dutch master.</P>
<P>As a Hofmann student, Cavallon was friendly with the organizers of the American Abstract Artists, and he exhibited in the group's annual exhibitions from 1937 until 1957. In 1946, Cavallon joined Charles Egan's gallery and had his first one-man show in eleven years. Although sales were few, Cavallon found himself in a supportive environment and enjoyed arguing art with Willem de Kooning, Jack Tworkov, Franz Kline, Philip Guston, and the other artists who showed there. He became a charter member of the Club—the group of Abstract Expressionists who habituated the Cedar Bar—and participated in the group's Ninth Street Show in 1949. After Egan closed his space, Cavallon exhibited at Stable Gallery, and then at Kootz Gallery in New York. He taught briefly at the University of North Carolina and served as visiting critic in painting at Yale University in 1964.</P>

Cederquist draws his imagery from numerous graphic sources, including Japanese woodblock prints, comic strips, television, and advertising.

"838","Artist Biography","<p>Chase graduated from City College of New York, where he also received his M.A. degree. He taught for six years in vocational schools before he had his first solo show at A. C. A. Galleries in 1973. A realist with a predilection for geometric abstraction, Chase works loosely from photographs, but dissects and reconstructs the buildings, store fronts, streets, bridges, and skies captured by his camera. Chase's urban landscapes are devoid of people and action and possess a precise linearity and atmospheric clarity that derive from the rectilinear planes and surfaces of his subjects. A great admirer of J. M. W. Turner, Chase describes his scenes as memories of visual events and says his goal in painting is ambiguity: "the multiple levels that paint can achieve."</p><p>Virginia M.

"840","Artist Biography","<p>William Merritt Chase, son of a shopkeeper, left Indiana at the age of twenty to study at the National Academy of Design in New York. Domestic financial reverses interrupted his studies as his family resettled in St. Louis. Young William's talent so impressed several businessmen in that city that they proposed to underwrite his further study abroad. In 1872, Chase began attendance at the Royal Academy in Munich, where he remained six years and acquired the flashy old-master style with dark palette and virtuoso brushwork, which characterized that popular academy. A sojourn in Venice with fellow students Frank Duveneck and John Twachtman rounded out his European training. He returned to New York in 1898 to assume a teaching post at the Art Students League, beginning an enormously successful thirty-eight-year career that would include such students as Edward Hopper, Georgia O'Keeffe, Rockwell Kent, and Charles Sheeler.</p><p>Once settled into Manhattan, Chase rented studio space in the old Tenth Street Studios, previously occupied by painters of the Hudson River school. Brimming with self-confidence and resolved not to be outshone in his accommodations, Chase acquired the vast salon space in which Albert Bierstadt had executed his monumental western landscapes. At great expense, Chase converted the studio into an exotic showplace, which became a social center for the local artistic fraternity; the gesture enhanced his reputation as a genteel Bohemian and also attracted numerous prestigious and remunerative portrait commissions.</p><p>In 1881 the Belgian painter Alfred Stevens encouraged Chase to abandon the bravura old-master technique he had acquired in Munich and to experiment with a modified impressionist style by lightening his palette and enlivening his picture surface with looser, more painterly brushwork. Chase explored this new direction further by experimenting with pastel and plein air painting.</p><p>In 1886 he married Alice Gerson, a family friend who had modeled for him, and they produced a large family whose members became favored subjects for his brush.</p><p>In 1892 he built a summer home at Shinnecock on the south branch of Long Island. There, among the dunes, in the bright sunlight and sea air his painterly impulse was given free sway, and he produced some of his freest and loveliest work. Shinnecock also became one of his most successful and popular teaching venues, and he was encouraged to initiate the Chase School in Manhattan, which was modeled on the Acad&#233;mie Julian in Paris. But Chase lacked the business acumen to make it succeed, and under other management it became the New York School of Art.</p><p>During these years Chase had developed and continued to employ two different styles of painting: the impressionistic plein air landscapes and genre scenes, and the somber realism of his portraits and still-life works. In his later years his still-life oeuvre was enhanced by an extraordinary series of fish studies, in which the artist's virtuoso brush transforms the pink and white luminosity of the recumbent fish to an object of almost abstract beauty. He often executed such studies in three or four hours.</p> <p>In 1902, after the premature death of his friend John Twachtman, Chase was invited to join the recently organized Ten American Painters and he continued to exhibit with them until the end of his working career. After a long and painful illness, Chase died in 1916, at the age of sixty-seven, mourned by hundreds of devoted students. Sadly, only three years before, examples of his work had been excluded from the momentous Armory Show, which signaled a new era for American art. Chase's reputation languished for several decades thereafter.</p><p>Emery Battis Artist Biographies for the exhibition <i>American Impressionism: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum</i> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2000)</p>",""

"875","Artist Biography","<p>Arthur N. Christie was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and studied at Pratt Institute, the American Artists' School, with Stefan Hirsch, and later with Hans Hofmann in New York and Provincetown, Massachusetts.(1) Christie began doing abstract painting about 1931. From 1937 to 1941, he exhibited with the American Abstract Artists. During the late 1920s and 1930s Christie worked as a designer of bank notes and currency. Among his accomplishments were designs for the national currency of Panama, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Turkey. He later worked for the New York office of civil defense.</p><p>Christie's paintings and drawings indicate his thorough acquaintance with Hans Hofmann's theories of space and balance within the picture plane. Both <i>Regatta</i> and <i>Kilimanjaro</i> draw from the natural world for their motifs, but the highly abstracted, rhythmic line with which they are executed indicates Christie's thorough conversion to modernist aesthetics and reflects ideas expressed in one of his few extant statements: "In presenting a work in the abstract we are manipulating hard/edge form. The evolving idea is couched in the landscape of form. And is transmitted by a plastic motility. Inherent in a calligraphy of form and/or line/the subliminal is indicated."(2)</p><p>In his later work, Christie explored Abstract Expressionism. In several highly detailed sketches for sculpture, he explored the juxtaposition of open and solid form using wire and wood. Christie did a large number of sketches from life and was fascinated with the human form in motion. He thought of himself as an artistic researcher and for a series of drawings designed a situation to test the validity of artistic transcription. He invited a dancer to improvise before two artists who made abstract sketches of the dancer's movements. A second dancer was then asked to use the drawings as a basis for duplicating the improvisation. The artists could then assess the effectiveness with which they had captured the postures, movements, and rhythmic changes of their subject.</p><p>A resident of New York in midcareer, Christie subsequently moved to Philadelphia where his paintings were occasionally featured in group exhibitions.</p><br /><br /><p>1. Apart from a few gallery announcements and an undated review of an exhibition inthe Arthur N. Christie Papers, Archives ofAmerican Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., little published material exists from which to reconstruct Christie'slife and career.

Cicero now uses biting wit and figural distortion to create cartoonlike scenes that suggest states of mind or being rather than perceived reality.

Although he is best known for carvings that reflect the humor and clever kinetic movement of these animated scenes and figures, several of his works, such as this <i>Crucifixion,</i> [SAAM 1988.74.4] depict serious religious subjects. Colclough characterized his shifts between humorous and religious subjects as unconscious. He stubbornly refused to carve anything suggested by others and his methods were sometimes unorthodox.

"943","Artist Biography","<P>Thomas Cole was the first of the Hudson River School of painters, often characterized as being the first native American school of painting. Though devoted to the study of nature, and usually thought of as a landscape artist, moralistic and religious themes were central to Cole's paintings.</P>
<P>Cole was born in Lancashire, England, and at the age of seventeen, he arrived with his family in Philadelphia. He worked as a commercial engraver at first, but by about 1823–1824 he had determined to become an artist. In 1825 he sold three landscape paintings and that summer he took his first sketching trip up the Hudson River. In 1826 he was elected to the National Academy of Design.</P>
<P>In 1829 he went to England and exhibited there, then to France, and in 1831–1832 he lived and toured in Italy. In Rome he occupied the studio of Claude Lorrain, the famous seventeenth-century French artist, whom Cole considered "the greatest of all landscape painters." In 1836 he returned to America and married Maria Bartow of Catskill, where he then set up his studio and residence. In 1841–1842 he made a second trip abroad to London, Paris, Rome, and Sicily. In 1842 he joined the Anglican Church. His first pupil, in 1844, was the landscape artist, Frederic E. Church.</P>
<P>Like [Washington] Allston and [Albert Pinkham] Ryder, Cole wrote poetry. He also kept a journal and wrote lengthy letters to his wife, friends, and patrons. Thus an intimate record of the viewpoint and activities of this gentle, pious, articulate, and reflective man is available through Louis Noble's books. A journal entry for May 31,1835, reads, in part:</P>
<P>"I did not go to church today. … I read a little, wrote, and walked, and looked at the landscape. … The south wind blew strongly, and dark masses of cloud moved across the twilight sky, the heralds of approaching storm. A leaden hue overspread the vale, the woods, and the distant mountains. How contagious is gloom! A flow of melancholy thoughts and feelings overwhelmed me for a time. I thought of the uncertainty of life; its bootless toil and brevity. The south wind, I thought, would still continue to blow, and bring up its dark clouds for ages after my works, and all the reputation I might gain had faded away, and become as though they had never been— swept by the wing of time into oblivion's gulf. And shall it be? Shall the spirit, that mysterious principle, unknown even to itself, that vivifies this earth, and generates these thoughts, sink also into the gloomy gulf of nonexistence, nor feel again created Beauty, nor see the Nature that it loved so much? It cannot be. The Great Originator, the Mighty One, the Unspeakable, hath not created for purposes vain and useless this power of conceiving … this wish and 'longing after immortality,' this hope … this faith which gives an energy to virtue, and raises in the breast these lofty aspirations … this fear of sinning, of deception and delusion. No! There are no fallacies with God. To prove that, if not to disprove all existence, would be to render all things doubtful."</P>

In 1939, the couple settled in New Mexico and Cook took up mural painting. His later work in oils, pastels, watercolors, and graphics won him critical acclaim.

"981","Artist Biography","<P>For Lia Cook, cloth is "both mundane and extraordinary." The recipient of many national and international fellowships and awards, Cook has been creating expressive "woven paintings" for years, but has recently developed themes that comment on icons of art history. Appropriating figures and motifs from the Venetian schools, Old Master paintings and the Bible, Cook puts them in a contemporary context on a computer-aided hand loom. She dyes silk cords, paints linen threads and weaves them together, combining direct hand-processes with computer technology.</P>
<P>Despite the involvement of man-made technology, the figures Cook paints seem to live and breathe from their poses in silk, rayon and abaca (banana plant fiber). In <I>Point of Touch: Bathsheba,</I> hidden hands reach out to touch the woman pressing the sumptuous cloth to her skin. "Those hands woven into the cloth underscore the notion of tactility and the sensuousness of the point of touch," said Jeremy Adamson, Renwick Gallery curator. "Cook has developed new ways of looking at cloth, and by weaving in feminist messages, she's created lush textures with multiple levels of meaning."</P>
<P>Cook, a resident of Berkeley, Calif., designs 3-D images that demonstrate the variety of differences in our perceptions of fabric. While the painted cloth drapes in Cook's "Material Pleasures" series look fluid and caressing, the sharpest lines of the images are softened by abstract patterns that embrace the form.</P>
<P>"I create sensual and complex works that focus on the meaning of cloth and what that suggests about being human and vulnerable," said Cook, who has studied textiles and lectured around the globe. "I'm attracted not only to the physical properties of woven cloth, but the meaning of textiles in a variety of cultures throughout history."</P>

"1047","Artist Biography","<P>"Art like worship and study should be functional, serve a definite purpose and out of that purpose can come beauty of expression and all other decorative characteristics." — Allan Crite, <I>The Artist Craftsman's Work on the Church,</I> <I>Commentary on the 1950s,</I> Vertical File, Library, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</P>
<P><BR>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Although he is best known for his religious illustrations, Allan Rohan Crite was a significant biographer of urban African-American life in Boston during the 1930s and 1940s. Crite was born in Plainfield, New Jersey, and moved to Boston during his youth and has lived there ever since. He studied at Boston University, the Massachusetts School of Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts School, and Harvard University, and was awarded degrees from the last two institutions. Crite has never married. </P>
<P>During the Depression years and into the 1940s when many African-American artists were engaged in mural projects, Crite developed a series of "neighborhood paintings" that were inspired by his Boston community's predominantly African-American Roxbury district. Crite has made the following statement concerning his neighborhood paintings:</P>
<P>My intention in the neighborhood paintings and some drawings was to show aspects of life in the city with special reference to the use of the terminology "black" people and to present them in an ordinary light, persons enjoying the usual pleasures of life with its mixtures of both sorrow and joys . . . I was an artist-reporter, recording what I saw." Allan Crite, <I>The Artist Craftsman's Work on the Church,</I> <I>Commentary on the 1950s,</I> Vertical File, Library, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>During the late 1930s Crite began to concentrate primarily on religious themes. His productions were largely in pen and ink and lithography. Crite, a devout Episcopalian, views his religious themes from a contemporary perspective. His illustrations are nationally known, and he is the author of three books, <I>Were You There?</I> and <I>Three Spirituals</I> published by Harvard University, and <I>All Glory,</I> a meditation on the Prayer of Consecration in the Eucharistic Rite of the Episcopalian Church. Crite has painted murals and <I>Stations of the Cross</I> in various parishes in several states, and has also designed private devotional works such as the Creed, Stations of the Cross, and parish bulletins that are furnished to churches in the United States and Mexico.</P>
<P>In 1937 Crite began a series of brush-and-ink drawings depicting three spirituals. This series was published in a large volume, <I>Three Spirituals From Earth to Heaven,</I> by Harvard University in 1948. The three songs selected by Crite are among the best loved of all African-American spirituals, <I>Nobody Knows the Trouble I See,</I> <I>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,</I> and <I>Heaven.</I> In Crite's highly individualistic approach he translated the text of the spirituals from a musical context to a visual one. The general theme treats the transition of man from the earthly sphere of his activities to his ultimate destination in heaven. During the time when many spirituals were conceived most African Americans were unable to read. Spirituals formed an oral tradition through which the lessons of the Bible were passed from generation to generation. The hymns are of two types, narrative and contemplative; narrative hymns tell stories from the Biblewhile contemplative hymns deal with lessons and ethical implications of the Bible in daily life.</P>
<P>The three hymns in Crite's illustrations are contemplative in nature. A human figure is used as the motif or melody figure in the first two hymns, and in the last spiritual the motif figures are first robes, then harps, and finally wings. The motif figures represent the melody, and the background represents the accompaniment. Small drawings on the left-hand pages of the book echo the character of the large illustrations and act as connecting links from phrase to phrase as the hymn progresses.</P>
<P>Crite's pen-and-brush drawings for <I>Three Spirituals</I> are probably the masterpieces among his religious works. From both an iconographical and technical point of view, the fresh and original treatment of each verse of the popular hymns was splendidly conceived. Crite's masterly handling of the brush-and-ink medium in which each line serves an expressive purpose reveals the talents of an artist with few peers among his generation. All of the figures in Crite's paintings and illustrations are represented as African Americans, and attest to his deeply instilled sense of racial pride.</P>

"1047","Artist Biography","<P>Brought up in Boston, Crite received his art training al the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the Harvard University Extension School in 1968. He worked for most of his life as an illustrator in the Planning Department of the Boston Naval Shipyards, retiring in 1976, but continued to paint at the same time. His work has been widely exhibited and well received in Boston, where a square is named after him. Crite's early paintings depict the daily life of Boston's African-American community, a community that was to be transformed in the following decade by urban renewal and housing projects. According to the artist, he sought to show viewers the "real Negro" as opposed to the "Harlem" or "jazz Negro," that was created by white people.</P>
<P>In his later paintings, magic-realist visions in which a black Virgin and Child ride on public transportation or float above the city streets, Crite used a bright palette rather than the more somber tones of his "neighborhood paintings." Compared with these earlier paintings, the religious works offer a message of hope and deliverance. During the 1950s Crite lectured on liturgical art and wrote and illustrated books with theological themes telling "the story of man through the black figure."</P>

"5336","Artist Biography","<P>From the humble circumstances of his birth as the youngest of ten children in Pennsylvania, Benjamin West became one of the most acclaimed artists of his day. Surrounded by little in the way of art in these Quaker surroundings, the precocious young artist moved to Philadelphia to paint portraits. Here he saw the work of William Williams, Gustavus and John Hesselius, and John Wollaston. At the age of twenty-one, West went to Italy to further his art training, which was made possible by the financial assistance of wealthy friends and patrons, which his amiable nature was to win for him throughout his career. The first in a long line of Americans to study abroad, West never returned to his native land, although he ultimately played an important role in its art.</P>
<P>In Rome West was attracted to German archaeologist and art critic Johann Winckelmann's theories on eclectic neoclassicism and the quest for ideal beauty through a study of classical art. West also studied the work of Italian Renaissance and Baroque masters.</P>
<P>On his way home to America, West stopped off in London, where he met with enough success to convince him to remain. West's history painting in the new neoclassical style attracted public attention and eventually King George III himself. Within five years of West's arrival in London he became a charter member of the Royal Academy. As a result of the acclaim given his painting <I>The Death of General Wolfe</I> (1770), in which the hero wore a contemporary uniform rather than the traditional classical garb, West was appointed historical painter to the king in 1772 and given a residence and studio at Windsor Castle. His agreeable manner and good looks won him favor in society, enabling him to retain the confidence of the king throughout the turmoil of the American Revolution. In 1792 West was appointed to succeed Sir Joshua Reynolds as president of the Royal Academy, a position he held, except for one year, for the rest of his life.</P>
<P>West's fresh approach to history painting was not the only reason for his important place in American art. As a counselor, teacher, and friend to three generations of American artists who came to England to study, West provided everything from advice, instruction, and food to money and, in many cases, a job as his studio assistant. In addition, he was an avid collector of paintings, drawings, and prints of the old masters, and casts of classical sculpture. His home and studio thus provided his American students, as well as English artists, with a gallery of art readily available for study, at a time when no such public collection existed.</P>

When he was 16, Cunningham, who lived in a fisherman's shack on Stratton Island off Old Orchard Beach, began painting images of boats and farms on wood he scavenged.

"1088","Artist Biography","<p>After graduation from Smith College, Charlotte Cushman studied art with Charles Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, during the summers of 1929 and 1930.(1) She then spent a year at the school of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and became friends with Eleanor De Laittre. In 1932, Cushman and De Laittre moved to New York where they studied with George Luks. Cushman remained in New York for only a year.  Responding to family pressure, she returned to Boston and resumed her studies, this time with Ernest Thurn, a Chicago native who had worked at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in Paris and the Royal Academy of Art in Munich, and had been an assistant in Hans Hofmann's Munich school. Cushman herself first met Hofmann when he visited Thurn's summer school in Gloucester, Massachusetts, following his first summer at the University of California at Berkeley.</p><p>Cushman first encountered Cubism and abstract art while studying with Thurn, although she did not develop her own variant of Cubism until after her return toNew York in 1937. She especially admired Georges Braque, whose paintings she knew primarily from books. Back in New York, Cushman supported herself by teaching part time. In the mornings she attended Hofmann's classes. The afternoons were given over to a sculpture course at the Art Students League. Although her schedule left little time for her own independent painting, she began exhibiting with the Contemporary Arts Gallery in New York. In 1940, she joined the American Abstract Artists, although she did not play an active role in the organization and seldom attended its meetings. Instead, she, De Laittre, and Fannie Hillsmith, whom she had known in college, met frequently to discuss their work, current exhibitions, and the impact that European artists fleeing Hitler might have in America.</p><p>The decade that Cushman spent in New York was a fertile period. She put aside the landscapes and figural work rendered with rich, painterly surfaces that had been the focus of her student years and began to merge an interest in Analytical Cubism with new  understandings of space and pictorial tension gleaned from Hofmann. <i>Shells, Buoys and Bottle</i> of 1944 exemplifies her mature artistic concerns. Still-life forms are dematerialized and three-dimensional space is dramatically distorted. The significance given the backdrop cloth and fish net represent a step towards the all-over compositional approach that played an important role in Hofmann's discussions of pictorial balance. Despite their finished appearances, Cushman's paintings began as highly realistic drawings from which she abstracted forms. Still-life arrangements are the predominant subjects, although Cushman did, on occasion, go beyond abstraction into completely nonobjective art.</p><p>In 1947, Cushman married and moved to Detroit. Finding little sympathy there for her modernist work, she stopped painting for ten years. When she again picked up her brushes, her technical and thematic interests had shifted. She did not return to the thin oils and egg tempera in which much of her earlier work was executed, but instead she chose watercolor as especially well suited to capturing the light and atmosphere of the Mediterranean area, where she frequently travels, in landscapes which are now her most frequent subjects.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"1144","Artist Biography","<p>Davis left school at the age of fifteen to work in a carriage factory where he remained for five years. His schoolmaster father then sent him to study for three years under Otto Grundman at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Financed by an Amesbury businessman, Davis studied in Paris for two seasons (1880&ndash;1881) under Lefebvre and Boulanger at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian, making frequent visits to Barbizon and the Fontainebleau region. As a result of his first exhibition in the United States in 1884, Davis realized enough money to allow him to remain in France for nearly ten years. Between 1886 and 1931 he received many awards, including a silver medal at the Universal Exposition of 1889 in Paris. He also exhibited at the famous Armory Show of 1913 in New York. Soon after his return to America in 1890, Davis settled in Mystic, Connecticut, where he lived for the remaining forty years of his life. During these years, he selected most of his subjects from a local rural area cut by the curve of a small river.</p><p>Until the early nineties most of Davis's landscapes emphasized the somber and the quiet in nature. One such work, <I>Deepening Shadows,</I> was greatly admired by Wyant and Inness; Thomas Clarke, Inness's most vigorous advocate, was also an early supporter of Davis. Animals, figures, and buildings rarely occupy an important place in Davis's paintings which, after about 1895, usually emphasized broad, blue skies, cumulus clouds, and brighter colors than those in the earlier works. <I>Edge of the Forest, Twilight</I> [Smithsonian American Art Museum]  is undoubetedly an earlier work by Davis and looks enough like the Apremont region of Fontainebleau to have been a souvenir from one of Davis's Barbizon visits.

"1147","Artist Biography","<p>[Gene Davis was] a major figure in 20th-century American painting whose contribution was invaluable in establishing Washington, D.C., as a center of contemporary art. Davis also played a significant national and international role in the color abstraction movement that first achieved prominence in the 1960s.</p><p>Born in Washington, D.C., Davis attended local schools and later worked as a sportswriter and White House correspondent before pursuing a career in art. Although never formally trained, Davis educated himself through assiduous visits to New York's museums and galleries as well as to Washington's art institutions, especially the Phillips Collection. He also benefited from the guidance of his friend Jacob Kainen, an artist and art curator.</p><p>Davis considered his nonacademic background a blessing that freed him from the limitations of a traditional art school orientation. His early paintings and drawings&mdash;though they show the influence of such artists as the Swiss painter Paul Klee and the American abstractionist Arshile Gorky&mdash;display a distinct improvisational quality. This same preference for spontaneity characterizes Davis's selection of color in his later stripe paintings. Despite their calculated appearance, Davis's stripe works were not based on conscious use of theories or formulas. Davis often compared himself to a jazz musician who plays by ear, describing his approach to painting as 'playing by eye.'</p><p>In the 1960s, art critics identified Davis as a leader of the Washington Color School, a loosely connected group of Washington painters who created abstract compositions in acrylic colors on unprimed canvas. Their work exemplified what the critic Barbara Rose defined as the 'primacy of color' in abstract painting.</p><p>Although Davis's work from the 1960s&mdash;mostly hard-edged, equal-width stripe paintings&mdash;is generally viewed in the context of the Washington Color School, his goal differed significantly from the other Color School practitioners. Artists like Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland generally preferred what Noland called 'oneshot' compositions, mostly symmetrical images that could be comprehended at a glance.</p><p>In contrast, Davis experimented with complex schemes that lend themselves to sustained periods of viewing. Davis suggested that "instead of simply glancing at the work, select a specific color&mdash;and take the time to see how it operates across the painting.&mdash;Enter the painting through the door of a single color, and then you can understand what my painting is all about." In discussing his stripe work, Davis spoke not simply about the importance of color, but about 'color interval:' the rhythmic, almost musical, effects caused by the irregular appearance of colors or shades within a composition.</p><p>Davis is known primarily for the stripe works that span twenty-seven years, but he was a versatile artist who worked in a variety of formats and media: modular compositions consisting of discrete, but related, pieces that together form one composition; collages combining cutout fragments of images and text with painted and drawn elements; Klee-inspired images that resemble musical scores; and silhouette self-portraits. His works range in scale from miniscule micro-paintings to mammoth outdoor street paintings. Works in other media include printed conceptual pieces, video tapes, and abstract compositions in neon.</p><p>In keeping with his unorthodox attitudes, Davis's works do not follow in an orderly sequence. Davis described his method as "a tendency to raid my past without guilt [by] going back and picking up on some idea that I flirted with briefly, say fifteen or twenty years ago. I will then take this idea and explore it more in depth, almost as if no time had elapsed between the present and the time of its original conception." As a result, similar works may be separated by years or even decades. &#133; Davis's works, which resonate with his romantic, free-wheeling approach to art-making, reveal a seriousness balanced by whimsy and an unpredictability that is always a source of joy.</p><p>Jacquelyn D.

"1151","Artist Biography","<p>Stuart Davis's anti-establishment view of life was informed by that of his parents, who both trained at The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His family and their bohemian circle of friends were instrumental in forming his progressive social views. An intense interest in "Americanness"&mdash;understood in terms of his Philadelphia background as well as a commercial and working-class present&mdash;formed a part of these views. Perhaps surprising to us, in an article in <i>The Soil</i> (an early avant-garde magazine) Davis listed an appreciation of colonial architecture as a proper subject for "young, robust . . . daring" American art, a viewpoint Davis recalled enthusiastically at the end of his life. Davis first went to Gloucester in 1915 with other artists working for the radical magazine <i>The Masses,</i> and ill subsequent years he spent most summers there. He referred to himself as an "addict of the New England coast," but his modernist eye made him look at typical New England subjects with a combination of humor and irony. Masts of old fishing schooners, for example, are seen among fish processing plants, gas pumps, and commercial signs. Despite critics' applause, steady exhibitions, and early patronage from Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Davis had trouble selling his work and only began to make a comfortable living in the 1950s. Nevertheless, his continually evolving approach to both urban and rural subjects, ant his active pursuit of artists' rights, kept him at the forefront of the modernist movement.</p><p>Virginia M.

By 1915 or so, Davis was experimenting with Cubist abstraction and collage, and in his Eggbeater series of the late 1920s, which he later called the basis of everything he subsequently painted, Davis analyzed a simple still life in terms of Cubist geometry and space. Although he employed a style that originated in Europe, Davis was an outspoken proponent of America. He considered jazz "the only thing that corresponded to an authentic art" in the United States and introduced billboards, cigarette packages, jazz rhythms, and other symbols of America into his paintings.

"1178","Artist Biography","<P>Dehn's satirical prints of European and New York scenes were the product of an unconventional Minnesota upbringing and an iconoclastic eye. The son of a feminist, socialist mother and an atheist, anarchist father, he was not destined for a quiet life. He studied at the Minneapolis Art Institute and the Art Students League in New York, after which he was imprisoned as a conscientious objector during World War I. On his release Dehn took odd jobs and made his way to Europe, where his work as a magazine illustrator supported him and his Russian immigrant wife in their travels. While in Europe Dehn was a critical observer of the social scene, especially in Vienna and Berlin, and a light-hearted painter of park scenes and landscapes. In 1930, after his return from Europe, his work, on both European and New York subjects, was shown at the Weyhe Gallery in New York City. The critical response was good, but sales were only moderate. In the mid-1930s, Dehn began to paint watercolor landscapes, which proved immensely popular. As a result, new commercial opportunities opened, including travels through the United States, Mexico, and Venezuela. His fame led to offers to teach and then to work for the Navy during World War II. Throughout the forties, fifties, and sixties, Dehn and his wife traveled around the world, doing commercial work and lithography. His work became less satirical and more fanciful, and he experimented with new graphic techniques. He died of a heart attack in 1968 while planning new trips, beginning a book, and organizing a retrospective.</P>

"1184","Artist Biography","<p>Eleanor De Laittre became interested in art after a course in art theory at Smith College. She left Smith to pursue her newfound interest and spent two years in life and drawing classes at the school of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. In 1932, she left Boston for New York, first to study with George Luks, and after  Luks's death, with John Sloan.</p><p>As a young artist in New York, De Laittre became friends with Fanny Hillsmith, who shared her growing fascination with modern art. Through illustrations and the paintings then to be seen in New York, De Laittre taught herself the principles of abstract art by working in the manner of European masters. An early painting explored form in the style of Modigliani, but, De Laittre explained, she discovered the laws of perspective after looking at Mir&#243;, while Klee's paintings inspired experimentation with textural richness.(1) Soon De Laittre put aside the portraits and landscapes that had occupiedher student years, and although not yet an abstract artist, her paintings took on a simplicity and a calligraphic clarity reminiscent of Raoul Dufy.</p><p>After her marriage in 1934, De Laittre moved to Chicago. Over the next several years, she exhibited regularly in annual exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago. Back in New York by 1940, she became active in the American Abstract Artists, with whom she exhibited annually from 1940 until 1946, and in the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. Her work matured during her six years in Chicago, and by the 1940s, Cubism offered the most compelling problems of space and form. The spatial configuration De Laittre employed in the small <i>Untitled</i> painting of 1949 is an adaptation from Picasso's large <i>Three Musicians</i> in the Gallatin Collection. By juxtaposing background areas of white, blue, and bare brown canvas, however, De Laittre enhanced the flattened space inhabited by the abstract linear shapes.</p><p>Increasingly during the 1940s, De Laittre turned to sculpture. At Ibram Lassaw's studio she learned the technical processes of welding in steel. Her highly refined, welded sculpture of the 1940s evidences a growing awareness of Surrealism, and the intricate interweaving of steel and open space showed affinities with the work of David Hare. Although she has never stopped painting, De Laittre now prefers the challenges presented by articulating three-dimensional form and space. Yet, the lyrical balance of mass and openness in her current sculpture retains echoes of her earlier affection for Analytical Cubism.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"1186","Artist Biography","<P>In 1929 aspirations and the energy of the Harlem Renaissance drew Beauford Delaney—trained in Knoxville, Tennessee, and Boston—to New York. By the mid 1940s he had forged close friendships with novelists Henry Miller and James Baldwin and gained wide recognition for his pastel portraits of well-known African Americans such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Duke Ellington. As comfortable with artists as with his neighbors in Harlem or Greenwich Village, Delaney conveyed his abiding love of mankind in paintings and drawings that ranged from the representational to the abstract.</P>
<P>As for many artists of his generation, New York's urban scene attracted Delaney's eye. In <I>Can Fire in the Park,</I> [SAAM 1989.23] anonymous men gather near a source of heat, light, and camaraderie. This disturbingly contemporary vignette conveys a legacy of deprivation linked not only to the Depression years after 1929 but also to the longstanding disenfranchisement of black Americans, portrayed here as social outcasts. At the lower left and upper right, objects that suggest street signs also function as arrows symbolically pointing the way up and out of desolation. Despite its sober subject,the scene crackles with energy, the culmination of Delaney's sharp pure colors, thickly applied paints, and taut, schematic patterning. Abandoning the precise realism of his early academic training, Delaney developed a lyrically expressive style that drew upon his love of musical rhythms and his improvisational use of color. Works such as <I>Can Fire in the Park</I> hover between representation and abstraction as that style evolved during the 1940s.</P>
<P>Neither early success nor gracious spirit spared Delaney from the obscurity and poverty that plagued him, particularly after he moved to Paris in 1953. In 1978—a year before Delaney died in a French asylum—the Studio Museum in Harlem initiated its Black Master series with a retrospective of his work, the first attempt to restore his forty-year career to public light.</P>

"1186","Artist Biography","<P>"The abstraction, ostensibly, is simply for me the penetration of something that is more profound in many ways than rigidity of a form. A form if it breathes some, if it has some enigma to it, it is also the enigma that is the abstract, I would think." — Beauford Delaney, quoted in Richard A. Long et al., <I>Beauford Delaney: A Retrospective</I> (New York: The Studio Museum in Harlem, 1978), n.p.</P>
<P>For more than three decades Beauford Delaney lived and worked in and around Paris where he earned the title "dean of American Negro painters living abroad." In 1945, when the writer Henry Miller published an article celebrating Delaney's art, he referred to his painter-friend as "the amazing and invariable" Beauford Delaney. Delaney was probably the most popular and best-known contemporary African-American artist then living abroad.
<P>Delaney was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1901 to a Baptist minister, Samuel Delaney, and his wife, Delia Johnson Delaney. Beauford, along with his younger brother, Joseph, showed remarkable skill in drawing during his childhood. Lloyd Branson, a local elderly white artist in Knoxville, gave lessons to Beauford, and encouraged him to study art in Boston. In 1924, when Delaney was sixteen, he moved to Boston and remained there for five years. Although he claimed to have been largely self-taught, Delaney attended classes at the Massachusetts Normal Art School and the South Boston School of Art, and enrolled in evening classes at the Copley Society. While working at various jobs to support himself, Delaney frequently visited the galleries at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. In Boston, he immersed himself in the art of the Old Masters, as well as nineteenth- and twentieth-century examples. </P>
<P>In 1929, Delaney moved to New York City; he lived first in Harlem and later moved to Greene Street in Greenwich Village. In 1930 Delaney held his first one-man show at the 135th Street branch of the New York Public Library, and in 1938 mounted a one-man exhibition at a gallery in Washington, D.C. Delaney's early works were primarily portraits executed in pastels, and he exhibited frequently in the Harmon Foundation shows during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1948, by the time Delaney, along with Ellis Wilson, held an exhibition at the Artist's Gallery in New York, he figured prominently in art circles. His paintings of the late 1940s consisted largely of street scenes and interiors executed in a thick, impasto technique with broad areas of pure bright colors. While living in New York, Delaney met and sketched many prominent African Americans of that period. To support himself, Delaney taught art part-time at a progressive art school in Greenwich Village,and did custodial work at the Whitney Museum. Following Delaney's move from Harlem to Greene Street in Greenwich Village, he painted that street and neighborhood repeatedly. Greene Street became a symbol to Delaney as Mont St. Victoire had been to Paul Cézanne.</P>
<P>During the early 1950s, Delaney's paintings became progressively nonrepresentational. He retained a thick, impasto technique, but his style was more closely associated with the abstract expressionism of the New York School of painters. Delaney continued to develop his abstract expressionist style between 1950 and 1951, when he received a fellowship to the Yaddo Art Colony near Saratoga Springs, New York. Yaddo probably inspired Delaney to travel to Europe and visit the "new Rome", which was much talked about at Yaddo. A benefactor financed Delaney's first trip to Europe, and his plan was to visit Rome with a stop-over in Paris. Upon his arrival in Paris, however, Delaney was so enchanted with the city that he decided to settle there. Delaney lived in Paris for the remainder of his life.</P>
<P>The majority of Delaney's early paintings, which he left behind in his New York studio, have been lost. He is, however, represented in the collections of numerous artists, writers, and musicians with whom he associated during the 1930s and 1940s. Delaney was able to support himself financially in Paris through sales of his paintings, subscriptions from friends, and a grant from the National Council of the Arts in 1969. Three main forces contributed to the development of Delaney's style: the techniques of Vincent Van Gogh, the color of the Fauves, and the design principles of abstract expressionism. From his early pastel portraits in Boston and New York, to the street scenes of New York's Greenwich Village, and finally to the development of a nonrepresentational style, Delaney's works were never merely derivative of previous styles. His paintings possess a personal spontaneity that distinguishes him as one of the foremost abstract expressionists of hisgeneration. By 1971 Delaney's heavy drinking and bohemian way of living had begun to take a physical and mental toll. He suffered an emotional breakdown. Not unlike William H. Johnson, Delaney was mentally incapacitated during his final years in Paris. He died on March 26, 1979, in an asylum, completely oblivious to his surroundings.</P>
<P>Prior to moving to Paris in 1953, Delaney lived on Manhattan's Lower East Side, an environment from which he delighted in selecting subjects for his paintings. </P>
<P>Delaney's thickly applied paint and the use of vivid hues also recall the techniques of the French Fauves, who painted at the turn of the century. Indistinct, raceless, Delaney's street people strike an ironically poignant note for a contemporary audience while also recalling the tradition of can fires among the urban poor and homeless.</P>

Even though some members of his family were amateur artists, the Demuths were convinced that their son would fare better professionally as a commercial artist. Demuth's teachers at Drexel, however, encouraged him to transfer to The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Trips to Europe during and after his five years at the academy (in 1907 and 1912&ndash;14) exposed Demuth to the vanguard art that was to influence his own style. When he returned to America, he divided his time among New York, Lancaster, and New England seaside resorts, where he spent his summers. In New York he exhibited first with Charles Daniel and later with Alfred Stieglitz, while pursuing a bohemian lifestyle. It was during his New England summers, particularly in Provincetown under the influence of Marsden Hartley, that he developed the precisionist style for which he is known.

Ward until 1886.  During these three years, he maintained a studio in New York, painting in the summers from 1884 to 1886 at his parents' home in Nyack, New York. In the fall of 1886 he went to Paris, where he entered the Acad&eacute;mie Julian. There, he studied under Bouguereau and Robert-Fleury for three years, taking additional classes at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts in 1889 and 1890.

Dessar returned briefly to New York in 1891 to marry and was back in France in the fall to begin an eight-month stay at Giverny. He built a home in &Eacute;taples in 1892, returning to New York during the winters of 1894 to 1897 to paint portraits. In 1900, with encouragement from his close friend Henry Ward Ranger, Dessar bought a farm on Becket Hill near Lyme, Connecticut, where he lived for the remainder of his life.</p><p>Dessar's early training in France was a wise beginning in the 1880s for an aspiring portrait painter; ironically, it provided the principal stimulus for his shift to landscape painting. According to William McCormick, Dessar was inspired to make this change after viewing several Barbizon landscapes in the drawing room of one of his wealthy sitters. Dessar's specialty from about 1897 on was dimly lit views of farmyards and pastures populated only by farm workers with oxen or small flocks of sheep, guided in their movements by little more than a glint of moonlight or a fading sun. Dessar's farmers are only small-scale allusions to Millet's peasants and eschew any hint of social commentary. <i>A Load of Brush</i> [Smithsonian American Art Museum, 1929.6.25] is somewhat exceptional here, not only because of the size and the strong, insistent silhouette of its subjects, but also because of the faceless anonymity of the rather wooden farmer, frozen in dark shadow with his docile beasts. <i>Return to the Fold</i> [Smithsonian American Art Museum, 1909.7.18] is, on the other hand, a more representative example of Dessar's deceptively meticulous studies of evening light.</p><p>Peter Bermingham <I>American Art in the Barbizon Mood</I> (Washington, D.C.: National Collection of Fine Arts and Smithsonian Institution Press, 1975)</p>",""

"1247","Artist Biography","<p>The timeless nature of Dewing's landscapes stands in sharp contrast to the ever-increasing pace of modern life in New England. Verdant, mysterious, and peopled with attractive, classically dressed women, Dewing's paintings provided fixed points of truth and beauty for a turn-of-the-century generation fearing the great changes in American culture wrought by immigration, industrialization, and urbanization. Dewing's father worked in a paper mill, suffered financial ruin, and died an alcoholic, yet he descended from one of the first families of seventeenth-century New England. Despite modest circumstances, Dewing studied at the Lowell Institute in the native Boston and traveled to Paris, where he enrolled at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian in 1876. Returning to Boston, he taught at the newly opened Museum School at the Museum of Fine Arts before moving, like so many writers and artists of his generation, to New York City. Living in New York, Dewing sought refuge from the vicissitudes of his new environment by returning annually, from 1885 to 1905, to the artists's colony at Cornish, New Hampshire. In Cornish, he perfected the misty, dream-like aesthetic that he used to depict a beautiful past.</p><p>William H. Truettner and Roger B.

Diederich attended Swiss schools before coming to America in about 1900 to live with his maternal grandfather, the artist William Morris Hunt.</p><p>Diederich's early artistic leanings were encouraged by his family, and he took classes at the Boston Art School in 1903. Formal education, however, held little interest for him. He attended Milton Academy but left without graduating and headed west to work as a cowboy.

Eager to pursue what he later described as "some higher branch of art," Dodge borrowed some miniatures from a friend and began to copy them. When his apprenticeship ended, he set up his own studio and began his professional career as a miniature painter.</p><p>Although he had no formal art training, Dodge practiced drawing from casts and statuary at the school of the National Academy of Design in the winter of 1826&ndash;27. In 1830, and regularly through 1838, his work was exhibited at the Academy. In 1838 Dodge left New York and headed south, where he hoped to find more work and less expensive living. After a brief stay in Alabama, he settled in Nashville, Tennessee, for the next twenty-one years. The rent on his studio was often paid by painting miniatures for his landlords, but Dodge also executed portraits of prominent statesmen and local citizens. Among these was Andrew Jackson, whom he painted in 1842. Dodge considered it, as he stated, "the most correct and perfect picture I ever painted." An engraving based on this miniature was produced and sold well, lauded by the New York Plebian, which stated, "No Democrat should be without this portrait in his house."</p><p>In 1845 Dodge bought 150 acres of land in the Cumberland Mountains about 150 miles from Nashville, where he built a log house and developed an apple orchard. To pay the bills he embarked on several ambitious painting projects, including the execution of dioramas. By 1850, the invention of photograph had put a dent in the market for miniature paintings. Dodge complained in an article he published in 1840, "Painting and Daguerreotype," that the new medium had several drawbacks, such as its lack of color and the glare on the images. However, he faced reality in the 1850s and began to take photographs himself.</p><p>In 1861, Dodge's loyalty to the Union led him to leave Tennessee when the people of his adopted state voted to secede. He returned to New York City destitute and, with miniature painting in decline, made his living largely as a photographer. However, he continued to paint, and in 1865 executed a portrait of President Andrew Johnson, copies of which were sold in photographic form. With his financial situation precarious, Dodge moved to Chicago, where he lived from 1870 to 1888. He served as vice president of the Chicago Academy of Design in 1874&ndash;75.

"1325","Artist Biography","<P>Arthur Wesley Dow, born in Ipswich, Massachusetts, was initially influenced by the Barbizon-inspired work of fellow Bostonian William Morris Hunt. In 1884, Dow traveled to Paris to study at the Académie Julian and to paint on the coast of Brittany.</P>
<P>On his return to Boston he taught for several years. In 1895, however, his career was transformed by a meeting with Ernest Fenollosa, curator of the unrivaled collection of Oriental art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Fenollosa introduced him to the wonders of the "floating world" (ukiyo-e), the great woodblock prints of Hiroshige and Hokusai, and opened up to him the recondite center of Japanese art: the conviction that art need not imitate nature but should develop organically from the formal abstract relationships of line, hue, and tone.</P>
<P>At about this time French painter Maurice Denis pronounced his famous dictum, which has since been regarded as a key to the contemporary aesthetic of painting: "Remember that a picture—before a war horse or a nude woman or an anecdote, is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order." Perhaps more forthright than the Oriental statement, but much to the same purpose.</P>
<P>Dow continued to teach and disseminate his newly discovered aesthetic principles. In 1899 he published <I>Composition,</I> which provided students with a series of exercises that taught the manipulation of line, color, and tonal relationships within a composition. In 1903 he became head of the art department at Columbia University Teachers College, which further spread his ideas across the country, influencing the first generation of American modernist painters. It is not unlikely that his authority and impact as teacher greatly superseded his importance as a painter, a destiny that also found such luminaries as Benjamin West before him and Robert Henri after.</P>

"1344","Artist Biography","<P>The son of a Lutheran minister who was interested in archaeology and the natural sciences, Werner Drewes believed that art provided an avenue to understanding the mysteries of life:</P>
<P>"What is the mystery underlying the Architecture of our Universe? What are the laws which create the pattern of the frostwhich forms on our windows? What causes the stars to stay in their orbit? What is it which creates joy and sorrow within us?. . . All these are problems belonging to the world we live in and which should concern the artist, as well as those problems of sunlight or the growth of a tree. But art is also a world with its own laws, whether they underlie a painting of realistic or abstract forms. …"</P>
<P>"To create new universes within these laws and to fill them with the experiences of our life is our task. … When they convincingly reflect the wisdom or struggle of the soul, a work of art is born."(1)</P>
<P>These words, written in 1936, provide a framework for understanding Drewes's work throughout his life. From his student days, he was fascinated with the formal possibilities of line and color. Yet, he was unwilling to forego the profound expressive potential of thematic motifs. Drewes moved easily between pure abstraction and expressionistic figuration, occasionally using highly energized abstract forms to express powerful emotions, as in his 1934 woodcut series, <I>It Can't Happen Here.</I></P>
<P>Following military service in World WarI, Drewes studied architecture and design in Berlin and Stuttgart. But he was soonattracted to the experimental freedom and the notion of the unity of the arts associated with the Bauhaus curriculum. In 1921, he enrolled in classes with Johannes Itten, Paul Klee, and Oskar Schlemmer. Unsettled yet as an artist, in 1923 Drewes began several years of world travel, initially to Italy and Spain, where he studied Veronese, Tintoretto, Velazquez, and El Greco. His <I>wanderjahren</I> then took him to Latin America (he had exhibitions in Buenos Aires and Montevideo), the United States, the Orient, and finally, via the trans-Siberia railroad, through Manchuria, Moscow, and Warsaw, back to Germany.</P>
<P>In 1927, Drewes returned to the Bauhaus, which had moved from Weimar to Dessau. But he found that its emphasis, as well as its location, had changed. The rather loose, experimental phase of the school's early years had yielded to a firmer commitment to design, to the potential for uniting art and technology, and to the artist's "new" social role in molding society.(2)</P>
<P>In spite of his preference for the earlier days, Drewes resumed his studies with Klee and Schlemmer. He attended Wassily Kandinsky's weekly painting classes and became close friends with Lyonel Feininger, Moholy-Nagy, and Josef Albers. He left the following year, however, at a time when the Bauhaus was in turmoil. He worked independently and taught, and in 1930, Drewes settled in New York. Kandinsky provided an introduction to Katherine Dreier, an abstract artist and founder of the Société Anonyme, who immediately began to include Drewes's work in the group's exhibitions.(3) He subsequently taught at the Brooklyn Museum (under the sponsorship of the WPA's Federal Art Project) and at Columbia University. In 1940 he was appointed director of the WPA's graphic art division in New York. In 1946, after additional teaching posts at Brooklyn College and at Moholy-Nagy's Institute of Design in Chicago, Drewes accepted a position at Washington University in St. Louis. He remained there until his retirement in 1965.</P>
<P>The obvious kinship between Drewes's <I>Pointed Brown and Floating Circles</I> and Kandinsky's paintings of the mid 1920s is more than a testament of respect from student to master. After a friendship begun at the Bauhaus, Kandinsky became Drewes's artistic mentor. The two corresponded frequently in the years after Drewes settled in New York, and the young Drewes assisted with Kandinsky's New York exhibitions. Kandinsky's letters are filled with news of the Bauhaus, the worsening political situation in Germany, and, when Drewes sent photographs, of reactions to his recent work. Drewes's frequent practice of painting thinly, which in this painting allows the woodgrained panel to suggest the organic movement of ocean in the sea-green foreground, is an aspect of Drewes's technique that Kandinskyespecially admired.(4)</P>
<P>A founding member of the AmericanAbstract Artists (by one account Drewes showed Arshile Gorky the door when the Armenian immigrant stalked out of an early meeting), Drewes exhibited more frequently in commercial galleries and museum exhibitions than did many of his friends within the group.(5) Drewes often received positive reviews, and his work occasionally won prizes during these difficult years.(6) He remained actively involved during the organization's early days and provided support and encouragement to his fellow abstract artists.</P><BR><BR>

"1353","Artist Biography","<P>Active in Cincinnati, Ohio, after 1840, Robert Scott Duncanson aspired to greatness as a landscape painter. By the 1860s the American press proclaimed him the "best landscape painter in the West," while London newspapers hailed him as the equal of his British contemporaries. Both then and now he rivaled the achievements of American landscape painters such as Thomas Cole, Asher Brown Durand, and John Frederick Kensett, who shaped the country's early landscape tradition in the Hudson River Valley style.</P>
<P>A mature example of Duncanson's art, <I>Landscape with Rainbow</I>[SAAM, 1983.95.160] belies his initially intuitive, schematic style. At mid-century, Cincinnati was a major regional art center where landscape painting flourished because of the city's cultural oppor-tunities and southern Ohio's appealingly unspoiled terrain. Exposure to paintings in the Hudson River style and travel throughout Canada, England, France, and Italy stimulated Duncanson's inherent talent. The well-accepted practice of copying engravings after paintings by other artists and his experiences as a diorama painter and photographer enhanced his technical skills. <I>Landscape with Rainbow</I> reflects the benefits of Duncanson's first trip to Europe in 1853. There he saw the paintings of seventeenth-century French landscapist Claude Lorrain, whose emphasis on classically organized compositions and atmospheric effects influenced so many American painters. In this painting, for example, Duncanson has organized a vast expanse along diagonals created by rock formations, lakes and streams, stands of trees, and mountain slopes. Washed by golden light, the broad pastoral scene exemplifies Duncanson's preference for nature's harmony and beauty rather than the terror and power of its forces. His traveling companion—landscapist William Louis Sonntag—also proved instrumental, for although the two men did not share a student/teacher relationship, Duncanson learned from Sonntag's meticulous technique and evocative use of color.</P>
<P>Tragically, mental illness ended the artist's career and life, a circumstance perhaps attributable as much to long-term lead poisoning as to the social and personal pressures of his interracial heritage. Ultimately, however, the psychological difficulties that he suffered do not diminish his ambitions and accomplishments as a photographer, muralist, and painter.</P>

"1353","Artist Biography","<P>"English landscapes were better than any in Europe, and the English are great in water color while the French are better historical painters than the English. I am disgusted with our Artists in Europe. They are mean Copiests. My trip to Europe has to some extent enabled me to judge of my own talent. Of all the landscapes I saw in Europe (and I saw thousands) I do not feel discouraged." — Robert Scott Duncanson in Letter from Duncanson to Junius R. Sloan, 22 Jan. 1854. Platt R. Spencer Collection, Newberry Library, Chicago, Ill.</P>
<P>Robert Scott Duncanson was perhaps the most accomplished African-American painter in the United States from 1850 to 1860. He was born in Seneca County, New York, in 1821 to an African-American mother and Scottish-Canadian father, who sent his son to Canadian schools during his youth. In 1841 Duncanson and his mother moved to Mt. Healthy, Ohio, near Cincinnati. Little else is known about Duncanson's early life except that his second wife Phoebe was biracial, and the couple's only child, a son Mittie, was born in Cincinnati.</P>
<P>It is not known when or where Duncanson received his early artistic training, but by 1842 he had begun exhibiting in Cincinnati. In 1853 Duncanson made his first European trip, which was apparently financed by an abolitionist organization from Ohio. He visited England, France, and Italy, and may have traveled to Germany. In England, Duncanson was especially attracted to the landscapes of Claude Lorrain and J. M. W. Turner. Duncanson's trip to Europe probably did not last longer than a year as he returned to Cincinnati in 1854 and became the proprietor of a photography studio. But by the following year he had switched from photography to painting full time.</P>
<P>Duncanson's paintings may be divided into five categories: portraits, regional landscapes, landscapes inspired by literature, still lifes, and murals. The largest and most important commission in Duncanson's career was a series of murals he painted for abolitionist and political leader Nicholas Longworth between 1848 and 1850 for the main entrance of Belmont, his residence in Cincinnati. The Belmont murals consist of four over-door compositions and eight large landscape paintings executed in a <I>trompe l'oeil</I> style. Each panel is more than six by nine feet, and are the largest paintings among Duncanson's works.</P>
<P>Sometime in 1849 Duncanson established a studio in Detroit where he had been active as early as 1846. His artistic activities were favorably noted in both Cincinnati and Detroit where he worked throughout his career. Duncanson was also at one time associated with the prominent African-American photographer J. P. Ball in Cincinnati. Ball employed Duncanson to execute finished oil paintings from daguerreotypes.</P>
<P>Duncanson's finest paintings are the landscapes of his middle and late periods. These works define him as a Midwestern romantic, realist painter. Although he spent the greater portion of his active years in Cincinnati, he traveled widely north and west of Ohio and also to the upper ranges of the Mississippi River. In 1851 a Cincinnati patron financed his painting trip to New Hampshire and Vermont. Later William Miller, a miniaturist and friend of Duncanson, wrote that during a visit to Cincinnati, he observed that Duncanson was executing beautiful Italian landscapes from sketches he had made while traveling in Europe in 1853.</P>
<P>During the early 1860s Duncanson traveled north, painting and sketching in Minnesota and Vermont, and crossing into Canada. Duncanson's second trip to Europe, as well as his Canadian sojourn, were motivated by his increasing unhappiness in the United States and a supposed desire to leave. In 1861 or 1862 Duncanson went to Scotland. His name is not listed in the Cincinnati or Detroit city directories from 1864 to 1866, and it is likely that he wished to leave the United States during the Civil War.</P>
<P>By 1867 Duncanson had returned to this country and began exhibiting works directly inspired by his European travels. He made a final trip to Scotland in the years 1870 to 1871, and completed a number of paintings during his stay. Back in the United States by the summer of 1871, Duncanson exhibited his Scottish paintings with remarkable success. By all indications Duncanson's career was flourishing, and his paintings commanded up to five hundred dollars each, a very high sum for the time.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, when his career seemed brightest, he succumbed to emotional illness. His mental collapse occurred during the summer of 1872 while the artist was arranging an exhibition of his works in Detroit. He was hospitalized for three months at the Michigan State Retreat, and on December 21, 1872, he died. Duncanson's obituary in <I>The Detroit Tribune</I> of December 29, 1872, stated that, "He had acquired the idea that in all his artistic efforts he was aided by the spirits of the great masters." The problems of a biracial person in pre- and post-Civil War America, as well as his concern for his status as an artist, may have contributed to Duncanson's breakdown. So too may have Duncanson's seemingly irreconcilable conflicts between the romantic and realistic tendencies in his paintings. Perhaps it was the romantic realm in which Duncanson sought to escape from the harsh realities of prejudice.</P>

In the 1830s, Durand ended his engraving business and entered into a short, successful period as a portrait painter of U.S. presidents and other Americans of political and social prominence. In 1837, a sketching expedition to the Adirondacks with the artist Thomas Cole, a close friend and mentor, led to Durand's decision to concentrate on landscape painting. Durand's subsequent annual summer trips to the Catskill, Adirondack, and White Mountains yielded hundreds of drawings and oil sketches that he later incorporated into finished paintings. From 1840 to 1841, he traveled extensively in Europe, studying the old masters and sketching from nature.

"1380","Artist Biography","<P>Thomas Eakins shared his era's fascination with the individual human being—with his or her capacity for intellectual achievement, psychological intricacy, and vulnerability to the ravages of nature. Yet among painters of his time Eakins was unusual in that he expressed this interest directly. Other artists turned their attention to nature, as did the Impressionists and other late-nineteenth-century landscapists, spending a lifetime painting fields, mountains, and flowers in dazzling sunlight. Some artists found satisfaction in still life arrangements—small worlds man had created—and still others painted genre scenes in which men and women pursued casual activity. Eakins was notable in that he alone seemed to understand the implications for art of the late-nineteenth-century intellectual attention to the nature of man. He might have said what the English lexicographer and critic Samuel Johnson made clear a century earlier: "A blade of grass is always a blade of grass. Men and women are my subjects of inquiry."</P>
<P>To carry out his study of men and women, Eakins chose the portrait format. Traditionally portraits had been commissioned, the artist collaborating with the sitter to portray him or her as the sitter wished to be viewed. But Eakins chose his subjects and uncompromisingly portrayed them as he saw them. When occasionally he did paint a commissioned work, the artist's assumption that he was the seer usually caused his patron to have second thoughts about living with the result.</P>
<P>Eakins's respect for human achievement led him to ask a number of scientists, physicians, writers, athletes, and musicians to sit for him. Most of these people lived and worked in Philadelphia, where Eakins spent his entire life except for the period from 1866 to 1870 when he studied in France and Spain.</P>
<P>Early in his career he typically painted large works that featured his subjects in their professional environment—for example, a surgical clinic, a boxing ring, or a concert stage. Eakins's extraordinary sensitivity to each human being's interior nature—even in works that portrayed subjects in their public capacities—their gaze or gesture with a private quietness that the artist had noticed. Later in his career, he eliminated aspects of the environment in favor of the simple bust portrait focusing on this introspective quality.</P>

"1381","Artist Biography","<p>In the mid-1960s Jack Earl was introduced to the world of European figurative ceramics through illustrated books in the Toledo Museum of Art's library. An art education and ceramics teacher at the museum, he was particularly attracted by the Watteau-like, painted porcelain figurines manufactured at Meissen during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He admired their rococo fantasy and sensuality, and was intrigued by their story-telling qualities.</p>
<p>By the early 1970s, Earl was creating his own representational hard-paste porcelains, But instead of the aristocratic imagery favored at Meissen, his own minutely detailed pieces depicted things, scenes, and people drawn first from the whimsical realms of his own imagination, and then from the more mundane world around him. By the end of the decade, Jack Earl had transformed the European tradition into a thoroughly modern and American idiom. Instead of sentimental, or idealized representations, he crafted startlingly real&mdash;and oftentimes surreal&mdash;characters and objects.</p>
<p>The subjects of Earl's porcelain sculptures generally are based upon the circumscribed lives and lifestyles of people in his own culturally isolated, small-town world in Ohio. Typically, his ceramic personalities are engaged in humdrum activities in vernacular surroundings. But while he represents life in rural Middle America, he does not depict it from the disassociated vantage point of a social commentator, satirist, or folklorist. Instead, Earl revels in his role as an active participant in ordinary affairs, and while he often pokes fun in his art, he always remains a sensitive recorder of the human condition. Attuned to the metaphoric and symbolic content of the prosaic lives around him, his porcelain individuals are often elevated to the status of Everyman.</p>
<p><i>Dear Fay</i> (1994.54.3) is a detailed landscape tableau that contains the figure of a demure young woman, standing on a sun-dappled lawn near a well, a bouquet of flowers and a straw hat held in her hands. On the flat, left-hand side of the sculpture a lengthy title is inscribed in an awkward, juvenile script: "Dear Fay,/ I saw you in church Easter. And I thought you looked real nice. If it is alright [sic] with you I would like to sit next to you next Sunday,/ Yours truly,/ Jack." Earl's porcelains are typically given such discursive titles. The suggestive, stream-of-consciousness writing style is intended by the artist to illuminate, but not to explain, the character and meaning of his individual pieces. They provide, in his words, "another view, or side of the object."</p>
<p><i>Dear Fay</i> is an evocation of Fairlie Faye Hanson&mdash;the artist's wife&mdash;as a young girl. In 1951, Fairlie's father, Roy Hanson, moved his family to Earl's hometown, Uniopolis, Ohio, when he was appointed minister of the local Church of Christ. As teenagers, Jack and Fairlie attended not only the same Sunday Bible class, but the same art class at nearby Wapakoneta High School. They married in August 1955, just before Jack entered his senior year at Bluffton College. Like virtually all his figurative works from the 1980s, <i>Dear Fay</i> is an imaginative construction based in part on found photographs. Earl is an inveterate collector of castoff snapshots. He will pore over old photos in junk shops, selecting images to which he feels unaccountably attracted. Acquisitions will often spark an imaginative connection with the memory of a previous purchase, and he will juxtapose the two photographs to assess the emotional linkage. If satisfied a symbiotic relationship exists, Earl will construct a sculpture that supports his intuition of a connection, and when finished, will create a title that supports his original insight, textually orienting it toward a more specific, personal meaning.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

"1408","Artist Biography","<P>William Edmondson, son of Tennessee slaves, did not consider himself an artist when he began carving around 1932, after retiring from his job as a laborer. Inspired by a vision, he emphasized his divine calling, claiming, "Jesus has planted the seed of carving in me" and describing his works as "mirkels." Edmondson carved gravestones, free-standing figurative sculpture, and garden ornaments, using discarded blocks of limestone and chisels fashioned from railroad spikes. Animals, biblical subjects, and secular figures like Eleanor Roosevelt and Nashville school teachers dominated his repertoire.</P>
<P>In several sculptures entitled <I>Crucifixion,</I> Edmondson celebrated Christ as the Savior, the most popular figure in the spiritual tradition of African-American art. The museum's example [SAAM, 1981.141] is an early version, once also called <I>Baby Jesus.</I> Its rectangular silhouette and upright frontality suggest the gravestone tablets that Edmondson saw in his original vision. <I>Crucifixion</I> retains a strong sense of the block's shape and texture in its minimally articulated form and detail. Only the emphatic curves of the lower torso reveal Edmondson's attempt to break away from the block, suggesting that he executed <I>Crucifixion</I> soon after he turned from carving gravestones to more imaginative, free-standing subjects. Compact and stylized, the sculpture conveys its spiritual message with the authority and immediacy of an archaic monument.</P>
<P>Edmondson's work coincided with the revival of direct carving in stone during the 1930s. Unaware of this development, he relied on divine calling and instruction, affirming his ties with other African Americans whose spirituality has provided the impetus for their art, music, and literature.</P>

Fuller, <I>Visions in Stone: The Sculpture of William Edmondson</I>(Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press, 1973), 12, 22.</P>
<P>The limestone carvings of William Edmondson were virtually unknown beyond his neighborhood in Nashville, Tennessee, until 1936. It was then that Louise Dahl-Wolfe, a New York photographer for <I>Harper's Bazaar,</I> saw his works while visiting friends in Nashville. Dahl-Wolfe took numerous photographs of the artist and his works, which she later showed to Alfred Barr, the director of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Barr was so impressed with Edmondson's sculptures that he arranged an exhibition for the artist during the following year. In late 1937 the Museum of Modern Art mounted ten of Edmondson's sculptures, and he became the first African-American artist to have a solo exhibition there.</P>
<P>Edmondson was born around 1882 to George and Jane Edmondson in Nashville. The exact year of Edmondson's birth is uncertain—a fire had destroyed the family Bible in which it was recorded. During his early adulthood, Edmondson was employed in a variety of menial jobs and as an orderly at Baptist Hospital in Nashville for almost twenty-five years. Having never married, Edmondson shared the family home with his mother and unmarried sister. Following the deaths of his mother and sister and his retirement from the hospital, Edmondson worked at various part-time jobs, grew vegetables for sale, and lived alone for the remaining years of his life.</P>
<P>Around 1934 Edmondson became a religious convert. He said he was called to preach and cut tombstones to God's command. He attended the United Primitive Baptist Church in Nashville, and remained dedicated to his religion during the years following his conversion. Edmondson stated that God first appeared to him in a vision and ordered him to obtain a mallet and chisels.</P>
<P>Around the same time, Edmondson discovered a pile of limestone that had been accidently dumped on his property and considered it a "gift from heaven." According to Edmondson's accounts, his inspiration was always divine. In a <I>Time</I> magazine article of November 1, 1937, Edmondson was quoted as follows:</P>
<P>"This here stone n'all those out there in the yard—came from God. It's the work of Jesus speaking his mind in my mind. I must be one of His 'ciples. These here is mirkels I can do. Can't nobody do these but me. I can't help carving I just does it. … Jesus has planted the seed of carving in me."</P>
<P>Edmondson began as a tombstone carver working in limestone, and he frequently provided tombstones for members of Nashville's African-American community. Later he progressed to carving figures. His sculptures are simple, rotund, emphatic forms ranging from one to three feet in height. The figures are roughly carved and forms are frequently suggested rather than articulated. He worked primarily in limestone, which was the only material he could acquire inexpensively or without cost. The quality of the limestone in Edmondson's figures varies greatly in color and texture—from a porous granular variety to a type almost as smooth as marble. The majority of the stones Edmondson obtained were rectangular blocks formerly used as sills, lintels, steps, and curbs.</P>
<P>Edmondson's career spanned a period of roughly fifteen years. Part of this time he worked under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration (W.P.A.), a government-sponsored artists' relief program. Unlike most W.P.A.-employed artists who were required to furnish some tangible evidence of their work, Edmondson was apparently not bound by any stipulations. He was free to create works of his choice, and his yard was cluttered with old stones and the images he created from them. These included tombstones, birds, doves, a delightful menagerie of animals comprising rabbits, squirrels, opossums, horses, tortoises, owls, lions, rams, and various other "critters" and reptiles. Edmondson's human figures included preachers, angels, choir girls, brides, nurses, teachers, boxers, comic-strip characters, and "courting gals on the carpet for husbands."</P>
<P>Most of Edmondson's sculptures are symbolic and were inspired by biblical passages. The frequent misspellings and omissions on his crudely lettered tombstones make evident the fact that Edmondson was barely literate. Edmondson's figure style is extremely simple—human faces are frequently curved forms with a few simple indentations denoting features. Feet are often without toes, arms without wrists, and legs without ankles. Textures are usually articulated in the hair of humans and fur of animals. Anatomical proportions are distorted in a manner that lends a vigorous and expressive effect to the pieces.</P>
<P>By 1947 Edmondson's health had begun to fail. He was stricken with cancer, which left him with scarcely enough energy to lift his tools. During the last few years of his life, he worked primarily with small blocks of limestone, and occasionally chiseled inscriptions on tombstones commissioned by members of his church. The grass in his yard had grown tall around his figures and oddly shaped tombstones, creating a virtual forest of mysticism and symbolic figures.</P>
<P>On February 8, 1951, Edmondson died. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Mount Ararat Cemetery on the outskirts of Nashville. Cemetery records for Mount Ararat were subsequently destroyed by fire, and the exact location of Edmondson's grave is unknown. It is ironic that a man who devoted years to carving tombstones for others does not have one identifying his own grave. With a few tools and a forest of stone ranging from Bedford limestone to common fieldstone, Edmondson lived in harmony with his religious beliefs. His works are indeed "mirkels".</P>

After graduating from Columbia College in 1847, he went to Paris and D&uuml;sseldorf, studying with Thomas Couture and Emanuel Leutze. Ehninger began his career as both an illustrator and painter, and by the late 1850s had developed a photographic process to make book illustrations from his drawings and those of other artists. A set of his drawings, photographed by Matthew Bradv, were used to illustrate Longfellow's "Courtship of Miles Standish." Another set appeared in an American edition of Tennyson's "Idylls of the King." Ehninger's genre paintings, done mostly in New York City, were post-Civil War renditions of charming country folk in idealized New England and Southern plantation settings. Later on, apparently discontented with urban life, Ehninger moved to Saratoga Springs, New York. In the late nineteenth century, and well into the twentieth, Ehninger's paintings&mdash;paeans to disappearing agricultural folkways&mdash;were thought to be faithful depictions of the places and people represented.

"1441","Artist Biography","<P>As a teenager, Herzl Emanuel studied art at the Rochester Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester, New York. Emanuel quithigh school in 1931, and, with the assistance of several patrons who recognized his talent, went to Paris, hoping to study with Emile-Antoine Bourdelle. Although the French master died with Charles Despiau and Fernand Léger and attended lectures given by André Lhote. He was soon joined by Hananiah Harari, then a student at Syracuse University, with whom he shared a studio and later accompanied to Palestine. In Paris, the two young men were intrigued by contemporary art. They felt its validity and power without fully understanding why Picasso, Matisse, and others could so successfully do such violence to the figure.(1) Believing the answer to their questions lay deep in the history of art, Emanuel and Harari spent a year drawing from the collections at the Louvre. Beginning with Hittite and Egyptian art, they worked their way chronologically to the nineteenth century, seeking to understand the structure and logic of the art of the past. In the Louvre, Emanuel says, we learned the grammar of art. We learned its syntax, its alphabet, until contemporary art represented no mystery. We learned its rationale, where it came from, the basic language. We saw its connection with the art of the past."(2) Although in Paris when<I>Abstraction-Création</I> wasbeing formed, Emanuel and Harari saw such publications but paid little attention to the theories or the movements germinating around them.</P>
<P>As fascism threatened Europe, Emanuel and Harari left for Palestine where they worked on a kibbutz for over a year. Although the kibbutz regimen left little time for art, the experience enriched them philosophically. After a brief stay in Jerusalem, Emanuel returned to the United States and in 1936 joined the sculpture division of the New York Federal Art Project.(3) During the mid 1930s, Emanuel was sympathetic with leftist political causes. By participating in the WPA, he said, "we felt we were working directly for society."</P>
<P>When war came, Emanuel went to work for a shipyard, and afterwards made his living doing display work. Later he worked as an illustrator. During the mid 1950s he taught illustration, sculpture, and a foundation course at the School of Visual Arts in New York. After six years, he gave up his teaching position to return to Europe. In Rome, he set up a studio that he still maintains.</P>
<P>Throughout his career, Emanuel's art has been centered in a deeply felt humanism. Art for him offers a way to come to terms with the human condition. Though he still finds inspiration in Romanesque and Italian Renaissance art, it was Picasso's <I>Guernica</I> that had the most dramatic impact in his life. Calling it the most significant work of art of the twentieth century, Emanuel has sought to achieve in his own work a fusion of abstracted form with tragic content that parallels Picasso's powerful statement. Since the 1930s, his sculpture has evolved from an Analytical Cubist format to an Expressionism in which the human form is distorted to convey the human condition. Yet by intertwining limbs and connecting gazes in multifiguralcompositions, he offers up human relationships as notes of hope that temper the effects of a tragic existence.</P>
<P>Emanuel participated in exhibitions of the American Abstract Artists for only a few years during the late 1930s. His fascination with Cubist formal structure, apparent in <I>Head of the Prophet</I> (1935) and <I>Lower Manhattan from Apartment in Brooklyn</I> (1937), later yielded to an expressionistic outlook. The growing domination of purist geometric abstraction within the group's program conflicted with Emanuel's evolving aims for his own sculpture, and he let his membership lapse.</P>

"1466","Artist Biography","<p>"I have no imagination. I never plan a drawing, they just happen. In a dream it was shown to me what I have to do, of paintings. The whole entire horizon all the way across the whole earth was out together like this with pictures. All over my yard, up all the sides of trees and everywhere were pictures." &mdash; Minnie Evans quoted in Nina Howell Starr, "The Lost World of Minnie Evans," <i>The Bennington Review</i> vol. 111, no. 2 (Summer 1969): 41.</p><br /><p>The paintings and drawings of Minnie Evans depict scenes from the artist's private dream world. But even to the artist herself, this dream world was not entirely comprehensible. Evans was born in 1890, the only child of Joseph and Ella Kelley, farmers who lived in rural Pender County, North Carolina, near Wilmington. Evans' parents moved to Wilmington during her early childhood, and she attended school there through the sixth grade. She married Julius Evans of Wilmington and had three sons.</p><p>Evans traced her background to a maternal ancestor who was brought to the United States from Trinidad as a slave. There are elements in Evans' art that invite comparison to Caribbean folk art forms, though the artist only once traveled outside her native North Carolina. The bright colors and floral motifs that appear in her paintings were most likely inspired by trees and flowers, especially azaleas, at Airlie Gardens in Wilmington, where Evans worked as the gatekeeper for many years.</p><p>"My whole life has been dreams . . . sometimes day visions . . . they would take advantage of me," Evans once said. She also recalled that in 1944 a fortune teller informed her that she was "wrapped completely in color," and that she had "something of all nations."</p><p>The dream world of Minnie Evans received its earliest visual manifestations on Good Friday 1935 when she completed two small pen-and-ink drawings on paper dominated by concentric circles and semi-circles against a background of unidentifiable linear motifs. Evans always placed a good deal of significance on these early drawings.</p><p>Evans' first paintings were done entirely in wax crayons and resemble an exercise employing every color in a gigantic box of Crayolas. The colors included greens shaded from light to deep, purples from mauve to pink, rose, and royal, and full ranges of reds, blues, and yellows with a sparing use of black and white. Evans' complex designs reveal an unaccountable presence of Caribbean, East Indian, Chinese, and Western elements in color and subject matter. Her own explanation of her work was that "this art that I have put out has come from the nations I suppose might have been destroyed before the flood. . . . No one knows anything about them, but God has given it to me to bring [them] back into the world."</p><p>The central motif in many of Evans' paintings is a human face surrounded by curvilinear and spiral plant and animal forms and eyes merging with foliate patterns. She equated eyes with the omniscience of  God and the concept of the eye as the window of the soul. The figures in her designs are sometimes portraits of ancient wise men and women who peopled her visions,ancestral visitors from some spiritual order, or angels, demons, and chimerical creatures. Evans' paintings are essentially religious in inspiration, and represent a world in which God, man, and nature are synonymous; God is frequently represented as a winged figure with a wide multicolored collar and rainbow halo. He is surrounded by a proliferation of butterflies, eyes, trees, plants, and floral forms in a garden paradise of brilliant colors contained within a cartouche-like frame of curvilinear rhythms.</p><p>The paintings and colored drawings of Minnie Evans are surrealistic without intellectualism or self-consciousness. They are the works of a visionary who equated God with nature, color with His divine presence, and dreams and visions with reality. The world as revealed through Evans' psychic revelations is a sacred province of complex visionary forms, angels, demons, hybrid plants, animals, and the all-seeing eye of God.</p><p>"Something told me to draw or die," Evans stated. "It was shown to me what I should do." The fact that her paintings "just happened to her" confirms that they are manifestations of an order of things unknown except to the artist herself. The art of Minnie Evans is a refreshing phenomenon&mdash;a lost world revealed through a subconscious that even she did not understand. Evans stated, "When I get through with them [the paintings] I have to look at them like everybody else. They are just as strange to me as they are to anybody else."</p><p>Evans died in Wilmington, North Carolina, in 1987.</p><p>Most of Evans' paintings are similar yet no two are identical. Reflecting the many  colors of the flowers of the botanical gardens where she worked, her paintings shimmer with the complexity of Byzantine mosaics. And like Byzantine mosaics, Evans' works embody a common religious intent and express the omnipotence of God.</p><p>Regenia A.

"1524","Artist Biography","<p>John Ferren was one of the few members of the American Abstract Artists to come to artistic maturity in Paris. A native of California, in 1924 Ferren went to work for a company that produced plaster sculpture. He briefly attended art school in San Francisco. Later he served as an apprentice to a stonecutter. By 1929, Ferren had saved enough money to go to Europe, stopping first in New York where he saw the Gallatin Collection. He went to France and to Italy. In Saint-Tropez, he met Hans Hofmann, Vaclav Vytlacil, and other Hofmann students. When Ferren stopped to visit them in Munich, he saw a Matisse exhibition, an experience that was instrumental in shifting his work from sculpture to painting.(1) In Europe, Ferren did not pursue formal art studies, although he sat in on classes at the Sorbonne and attended informal drawing sessions at the  Acad&#233;mie Ranson and theAcad&#233;mie de la Grande Chaumi&#232;re. Instead, Ferren said, he "literally learned art around the caf&eacute; tables in Paris, knowing other artists and talking."</p><p>After this initial year in Europe, Ferren returned to California. By 1931, he was again in Paris, where he lived for most ofthe next seven years.(2) Surrounded by the Parisian avant-garde, Ferren wrestled with his own idiom. His diaries from these years indicate far-ranging explorations&#151;from a Hofmann-like concern for surface to the spiritual searches of Kandinsky and Mondrian.(3)</p><p>Although Gallatin and Morris were the first Americans to buy his paintings, Ferren associated with members of the  Abstraction&#151;Cr&#233;ation group rather than with the American expatriate community. He married the daughter of a Spanish artist, Manuel Ortiz de Zarate. Through this union he met the circle of Parisian-Spanish painters that included Picasso, Mir&#243; and Torres-Garcia. With Jean H&#233;lion, Ferren wrote manifestoes against Surrealism, although he remained friendly with Max Ernst and Andr&#233; Breton, and illustrated books by Surrealist poets. In Paris, he met Pierre Matisse who in 1936 hosted a show of Ferren's work at his New York gallery.</p><p>Following his divorce in 1938, Ferren returned to the United States. He attended American Abstract Artist meetings but felt little of the frustration that had prompted the organization's formation. After AdReinhardt used Ferren's name without permission on a pamphlet passed out onthe Museum of Modern Art picket line, Ferren broke from the group.</p><p>During World War II, Ferren served with the Office of War Information in the North African and European theaters. By this time, Ferren had reintroduced the figure into his paintings without giving up abstraction, and following the war he turned to Abstract Expressionism.</p><p>In moving from geometric abstraction to the academically based figure and still-life paintings he did after the war, and finally to the freely painted expressionist work of his later years, Ferren searched for a way to express moral truth. Throughout his life, he viewed painting as a means of seeking the reality behind appearance. His early appreciation of Kandinsky and a fascination with Zen that dated from his youth helped define the way he thought about painting throughout his life. He called art the "great common denominator between knowledge and insight," and said it should explore the intuitive&mdash;the spiritual, mental, social, or psychological&mdash;forces of life.(4)</p><p>Ferren was an early member of The Club, an organization of Abstract Expressionists, and in 1955 served as its president.

"1543","Artist Biography","<P>I half expected a choir of angels on silvery wings to announce the death of the Reverend Howard Finster, but instead I learned from Roberta Smith in the <I>New York Times</I> that Georgia's most prominent artist had died last October 22 at the age of eighty-five. Perhaps it was no less miraculous that a Baptist preacher from the tiny town of Pennville commanded the attention of the art world. Finster loved an audience.</P>
<P>He was a larger-than-life personality with a devoted following long before he appeared on the Johnny Carson Show or in an R.E.M. music video. For his speaking engagements, he wore a powder-blue suit and had his banjo at the ready. He sang with a melodious twang, and he could yodel with force, but it was his compelling "sermons in paint" that made him a folk art phenomenon.</P>
<P>Born in Valley Head, Alabama, Finster was one of thirteen children. At sixteen he preached his first sermon. In the 1940s, he hosted a radio program and wrote a column for the local newspaper. He led tent revivals and "pastored" many churches. To support his wife, Pauline, and their five children, he was also a bricklayer, a carpenter, a plumber, and took up the "hard times business" of bicycle and lawn mower repair. He had a great sense of humor, which he used in the service of the Word. He once told me, "When I'm in big revivals, about the first thing I do a lot of times is to get the people tickled a little bit, get their mind off everything, then I get the message over to 'em."</P>
<P>Finster never tired of telling the story of how he came to be an artist. In 1976, he dipped his finger in white paint and saw a perfect human face on the ball of his finger, and "while I was lookin' at it a warm flash kind'a went all over me, all the way down, and it said, 'Paint sacred art.' And I said to it, I said, 'I cain't do that. I know professionals can, but not me.' And it comes to me again and it says, 'How do you know?' I said, 'How <I>do</I> I know that I cain't paint.' I tuck a dollar out of my wallet, and I pasted it on a piece of plyboard and went out in front of my shop, and I started drawing George Washington off that dollar bill." Whether true or not, the story stands as a parable of his faith in divine visions, as well as in his ability to make money.</P>
<P>In the 1960s, he began constructing Paradise Garden, a two-acre spiritual environment at his home in Pennville. His plan was to display all the inventions of mankind. Embedded in the garden's cement walls, walkways, and playhouses were Bible verses, accumulated bicycle parts, TV tubes, mirror glass, Coca-Cola bottles, junk jewelry, plastic toys, a mound of cement snakes, and his son's tonsils "put up in alcohol." Finster displayed his paintings and plywood cutouts ("dimensions") of Santa Claus, Abraham Lincoln, famous inventors, and Bible figures in the garden, and it wasn't long before collectors and the curious beat a path to his door to buy his art. "They'd come here and just blow up on it, so I'd just take the crowbar and start pulling it off," he told me. He made thousands of works of art that often combine written words with his own vocabulary of visual images.</P>
<P>At home Finster would kick back on his studio couch witha chaw of tobacco in his cheek and carry on a stream-of-consciousness monologue for hours. Like a perpetual-motion machine, he seemed to gain energy from his own oration. He had lots of ideas, mostly about how to fix things, from TVs to the Middle East crisis. His handyman's sensibility made anything seem possible. For all of his fire-and-brimstone swagger, there was a sweetness about him. He encouraged people to discover their hidden talents; if they didn't, "it was just like takin' a quart of milk and stickin' it in the refrigerator and lettin' it sit there till it spoils." He also talked about his visions—all the strange and beautiful sights on his travels through the twilight zone. He told me that he had walked through hell and had witnessed eternal suffering, that Elvis Presley had appeared to him, and that he'd seen other fantastic scenes as well. The next minute he'd be down to earth. He didn't like buying anything on credit because he couldn't see much difference in paying for something and then waiting a week to pay interest on it. There was a fine line between his religious convictions and pure business savy; he didn't sign contracts, he told me, because God is a free agent.</P>
<P>One could say that all artists are visionaries, but Finster was tuned to a special frequency. He took on the the big topics—life and death, redemption and salvation. In the 1970s and 1980s, that angst-ridden era of few certainties, here was a man of solid convictions, pointing the way. It's no wonder he was a hero to hipsters.</P>
<P>I first met Finster in the summer of 1984, when I interviewed him for the Archives of American Art's oral history program. He was in Washington, D.C., for an exhibition at the Anton Gallery, then on Capitol Hill. The interview almost didn't happen because he wanted to be paid. A novel idea. We negotiated. He agreed to talk and sing and preach for free, for hours. (His words quoted here are all from that 1984 tape recording.) After the interview we had lunch at the cafeteria in the Old Patent Office Building, where the archives were then located. He was so tickled with the choices that he took one of everything. We spent the afternoon in the courtyard under the elm trees feeding his leftover sandwiches to a growing flock of pidgeons.</P>
<P>In 1988 I took a film crew to Finster's compound to shoot a segment for the TV program <I>Smithsonian World,</I> and we continued to correspond quite a bit in the 1990s. He had a special regard for the Smithsonian Institution, which mirrored his mission to collect the wonders of the world. And he was grateful to the Archives of American Art for microfilming his papers and making them freely available. The film crew and I arrived with the worst snowstorm to hit Georgia in forty years. What bad luck, I thought, as I scraped the frost form the windows, a virutal prisoner of the only motel in town. We had two days to film Paradise Garden, which was buried under a pile of snow. I had little faith, but Finster saved us. With the cameras rolling, it was <I>more</I> remarkable to to hear him talk about what was under the snow than to actually see it. It was a striking demonstration of his power to behold the hidden, to show us a world that only he could see. He had spent a lifetime animating the intangible—from the fiery pits of hell to heavenly mansions "beyond the light of the sun."</P>
<P>He thought that good Christians were scarce. In his own words he was "one of the world's last red lights." "I'm not here to live a normal life," he told me. "I'm sent here on a mission. I was fore-predestinated for this planet. Just like Henry Ford." I admired his compulsion. He worked night and day with all of his energies bent toward the single-minded purpose of spreading the Word. Recalling his remarkable journey, he said, "It's all been fun, it's all been spiritual, it's all been rejoicing, it's all been a sacrifice. It's been a hard road. It's been an easy road. It's just been everything." With Finster's passing, I will look more closely at his paintings, searching the surfaces for a smear of paint with the perfect face of Howard Finster looking back at me.</P>

"1543","Artist Biography","<P>The Reverend Howard Finster is perhaps the most famous religious artist alive today.

He claims God charged him to illustrate his religious visions in 1976 when "A warm feeling came over me to paint sacred art."</P>
<P>Finster began building his everchanging environmental sculpture, <I>Paradise Garden,</I> on swampy land behind his house in the early 1960s.

"1641","Artist Biography","<p>Helen Frankenthaler's works helped redefine painting.  From the Renaissance on, a painting was considered a window onto the world, through which one saw an illusion of reality.  This concept was challenged intensely throughout the first half of the twentieth century, climaxing in the 1950s with the work of artists like Frankenthaler and Jackson Pollock.</p><p>Frankenthaler returned home from college in 1949 to her native New York, the city producing the most revolutionary art of the day.  Within two years she was moving in the same circles as those responsible for this new work.  Her commitment to the Abstract Expressionists, combined with her appreciation of past art, resulted in a new painting technique and works such as <i>Small's Paradise</i> [SAAM, 1967.121].  She spread huge pieces of canvas on the floor of her studio, pouring the acrylic paint from cans and pushing it with sponges.  Frankenthaler thinned the paint so that the pigment did not sit on the surface of the canvas as paint always had, but soaked into the fabric, establishing a new relationship between the medium and its support. Frankenthaler's "stain painting" was her personal invention.</p><p>The existence of a distinct feminine aesthetic, an issue that has preoccupied many critics, is particularly relevant to Frankenthaler's expressively fluid work.  Frankenthaler herself in 1965 questioned those who saw her work solely in terms of gender, calling this approach "superficial."  Later in the same interview, however, she mused, "I wonder if my pictures are more lyrical (that loaded word!) because I'm a woman?"</p><p>Elizabeth Chew <i>Women Artists</i> (brochure, Washington, DC: National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution)</p>",""

"1666","Artist Biography","<P>French was born in Exeter, New Hampshire, and raised in Cambridge and Concord, Massachusetts, the twin literary capitals of old New England. Home to such major writers as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the Alcott family, the romantic tales spun in (and about) these historic communities held sway over French and the nation for the rest of the nineteenth century.

Abigail May Alcott was his first art teacher and French came to prominence with his statue of the <I>Minute Man,</I> a work commissioned by the town in 1873. Although President Grant, James Russell Lowell, Emerson, and Longfellow attended the dedication, the sculptor himself was absent, having left in 1874 to pursue his studies in Italy.

"1698","Artist Biography","<P>George Fuller was brought up on a farm in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and periodically returned to it throughout his life. In 1841 he was an itinerant portraitist with his half brother, Augustus, in northern New York. During the winter of 1841–1842, he studied in Albany, New York, with sculptor Henry Kirke Brown. During the following two winters, he studied at the Boston Artists' Association and shared a studio with sculptor Thomas Ball. Fuller took classes at the National Academy of Design in 1847 after moving to New York City, which—except for one year in Philadelphia and three winters in the South—was to be his home for the next twelve years. After assuming management of the Deerfield farm in 1859 upon the death of his father, Fuller spent five months touring Europe in 1860 to study the old masters and to sketch. For the next fifteen years, he devoted himself largely to farming, but in the spring of 1876, economic necessity and the "discovery" of a new style and technique brought Fuller back to Boston again, and he exhibited there to considerable acclaim during the remaining eight years of his life.</P>
<P>Fuller's trip abroad in 1860 included a study of a wide spectrum of the old and new in European painting: Millet, the Pre-Raphaelites, Corot, and Rembrandt were among the artists given special attention. The lengthy sojourn on his Deerfield farm that followed this trip allowed Fuller's discoveries to mellow in his mind until he had slowly developed a mode of vision that was particularly his own. Eastern America's gowing taste for the sweet, sad look of American's tone poets undoubtedly contributed to the somewhat exaggerated acclaim accorded Fuller during his final years.

The mood evoked is one that, in James Flexner's words, "luxuriates in not being forced to accept from the senses any data that does not serve its immediate imaginative ends." Not surprisingly Fuller was a great favorite of the New England <I>literati</I> and his wistful sense of nostalgia was often compared to that of Corot, an artist with whom he had little else in common.</P>

"1720","Artist Biography","<p>Painter, writer, patron, founder of the Gallery of Living Art at New York University, Albert Gallatin's contributions to abstract art in New York took many forms. Trained as a lawyer, Gallatin never practiced. Instead he concentrated his energies on collecting and writing about art. Initially interested in Aubrey Beardsley, James McNeill Whistler, the American Impressionists, and other turn-of-the-century artists, Gallatin turned to modern art in the 1920s.(1)  By 1927, his collection had grown sufficiently to be shown publicly. He established the Gallery of Living Art, dedicated to the ongoing display of European moderns.(2) Located on Washington Square&#151;near the studios of many young painters&#151;New York University became home for his collection. There, Gallatin hoped to create an informal atmosphere for intellectual exchange, as well as a place where artists could congregate and study the newest developments in European art.</p><p>By 1933, when its second catalogue was published, the Gallatin Collection featured paintings by C&eacute;anne, Picasso, Braque, L&eacute;ger, Gris, Mondrian, Ozenfant, Torres-Garcia, and others. With Jean H&eacute;lion, who served as advisor and friend, Gallatin increasingly focused his collection on a unified view of modernism. By 1937, its core artists were Picasso, Gris, L&eacute;ger, and Braque. Masterworks purchased included Picasso's large <i>Three Musicians</i> and L&eacute;ger's <i>The City</i>. Gallatin began adding work by American moderns as well.(3)</p><p>Gallatin's collecting brought him into contact with leading artists and groups of the day. He knew many of the members of <i>Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation,</i> andits short-lived predecessor <i>ArtConcret.</i> He visited the studios of Picasso, Braque, Mondrian, Mir&oacute;, and others, during his annual trips toParis. As important as his acquaintance with these artists was for his own painting, of greater significance was the link it provided between them and the growing circle of vanguard artists in New York.</p><p>Although many young Americansfollowed the Parisian art scene through <i>Cahiers d'Art,   Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation,</i> and othermagazines, the opportunity to study original work firsthand was unparalleled. Through purchases for the collections and backing for exhibitions, Gallatin lent significant support to his younger colleagues. He bought paintings by Rupert D. Turnbull, Gertrude Greene, Jean Xceron, Charles Biederman, John  Ferren, George L.K. Morris, and Charles Shaw. He sponsored shows of work by Alice Trumbull Mason, Esphyr Slobodkina, and others. In 1936, under the auspices of the Gallery of Living Art, the Paul Reinhardt Galleries presented Five Contemporary American Concretionists, a widely reviewed exhibition of work by Biederman, Alexander Calder, Ferren, Morris, and Shaw.</p><p>Gallatin viewed modern art in international terms. He considered the gallery to be akin to a scientific laboratory where experimentation and explorationwere documented.(4) H&eacute;lion agreed, and in an essay for the 1933 catalogue of the collection, further argued that the newest developments should be understood as part of an evolutionary process. The concerns of "politics and the struggle for life," so popular among Social Realists, had no place in modern art.(5)</p><p>In December 1942, New YorkUniversity determined to retrieve the space occupied by the Gallatin collection. Looking about for another site, Gallatin rebuffed overtures from Alfred Barr at the Museum of Modern Art because he found Barr's lack of sympathy for younger American abstract artists disturbing. He gave the collection to the PhiladelphiaMuseum of Art.</p><p>Although Gallatin's perceptive eye benefited from the advice of H&eacute;lion, Morris, and others, his acute understanding of the formal basis of Cubism and other modernist forms is clear from his own paintings. During the mid 1920s, when Gallatin was fifty-five, he began painting in a modified Cubist style.Both the <i>Untitled</i> canvas of 1936 and <i>Composition</i> (1937) reflect Gallatin's admiration for Juan Gris, whose "honest and profound paintings, so free from all pretention, take on more and more weight year by year."(6)</p><p>Although Gallatin provided substantialmoral and financial support for the American Abstract Artists, and was among the early, although not original members, he was both older and considerably wealthier than most of its members. Along with Charles Shaw, George L.K. Morris, and Suzy Frelinghuysen, Gallatin was dubbed a "Park Avenue Cubist."  He remained a man whose elegant life style set him apart from the younger, poorer members of the group.</p><br /><br /><p>1. Gallatin's first major publicationappeared in 1903: <i>Aubrey Beardsley's Drawings.</i> The following year he wrote <i>Whistler's Art Dicta;</i> additional volumes on Whistler appeared in 1907 and 1912.</p><p>2. Among the almost seventy works featured in the opening exhibition of the Gallery of Living Art were paintings by Braque, C&eacute;anne, Chagall, de Chirico, Gris, L&eacute;ger, and Picasso.</p><p>3. Figurative art took a second place in the collection, and Gallatin removed from the collection work by Pavel Tchelitchew, Morris Kantor, Max Ernst, and Henry Billings. Surrealists were also discarded, although Mir&oacute; and Masson, due to "technical virtuosity", remained within the gallery's purview. He reduced his holdings to one work each by Marin, Demuth, and Sheeler, but added Calder, Ferren, Morris, Shaw, and others whose work had direct links to recent European art.</p><p>4.

"1740","Artist Biography","<p>Ed Garman was born in Bridgeport,Connecticut, but grew up in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. In 1933, he entered the University of New Mexico. While working for the university theater, he discovered the work of Adolph Appia and Edward Gordon Craig, turn-of-the-century pioneers of modern stage sets whose stark, simple designs opened Garman's eyes to the dramatic possibilities of structural form. Later, working for a WPA project, Garman sorted pottery shards at an archaeological dig and became fascinated with the patterns and arrangements of Indian designs. These two discoveries shaped his growing enthusiasm for abstraction, as did a 1935 retrospective of van Gogh's paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago. Shortly thereafter, Garman completed his first group of semiabstract paintings. Yet Garman was not convinced that his own future lay in abstraction. Consequently, he went to Mexico for six months in 1937 to study murals by Diego Rivera and Clemente Orozco. He found himself unimpressed, however, by the nationalistic context of the Mexican muralists. He turned instead to art history, seeking in the art of the past the clues that would enable him to better understand his own reactions to his environment.</p><p>Garman was fully conscious that becoming an artist in the 1930s was a risky decision:</p><p>"The Great Depression was in full swing. Contemplating going into the arts as a lifetime profession was the ultimate in an irrational hope and a guarantee of economic and social suicide. Then, of all things, to choose an area of interest inpainting that was so coldly received as was abstract painting was yet another step into the twilight zone."(1)</p><p>Yet the challenges were exciting. Garman compared them to the feelings of a scientist "discovering an improbable life form that seemed to contradict all other forms of life and yet lived. Abstraction was like that&mdash;it lived."(2)</p><p>Garman joined the Transcendental Painting Group in 1941, several years after the group's formation. By this time he had become close friends withRaymond Jonson, who encouraged the younger artist to continue with his painting and his ideas. But World War II intervened, and in late 1943 Garman left New Mexico to serve with the U.S. Navy in California. Despite little time to paint, his ideas about abstraction continued to germinate, fueled in part by the progressive exhibitions he saw at the San Francisco Museum of Art. By the mid 1940s, Garman had developed a sophisticated theory he called "dynamic painting" in which varied empathetic responses could be stimulated through elements of movement and its counterpoint, rest.</p><p>The war had a tremendous impact on Garman's artistic ideas: "[It] has shown me more than ever the terrific need for anidealism that is truly transcendental. It has shown me more than ever the poverty of spiritual beauty in the world. &#133;"(3)</p><p>In contrast to Raymond Jonson, who worked intuitively, Garman conceived his paintings in intellectual terms, using geometries, rather than sinuous, rhythmic forms as the structural basis for his work. In <i>Composition #261,</i> for example, brightly colored geometric shapes dance in a yellow field, creating rhythms through color rather than through directional form.Garman described his artistic development as steady and consistent. His paintings evolved "from a highly simplified and almost primitive realism through the various shades of the abstract to the nonobjective."(4) In his later work he has continued to explore movement and rest through geometric form and has retained the vitality of color so important in his paintings of the 1940s.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"2211","Artist Biography","<P>After the death of his mother in 1878, Eugene Higgins lived with his father, an Irish stonecutter and builder, in a Saint Louis boardinghouse. After attending public scool and a commercial college in Saint Louis, he studied art in Paris at the Académie Julian (1897–1898) and at the École des Beaux-Arts (1899–1904) under Gérôme. During his seven years in France, he copied in the Louvre and made visits to Spain, Holland, and Italy. Upon his return to the United States in 1904, he traveled briefly before establishing his studio in New York, where he remained except for summers spent in Old Lyme, Connecticut. He showed two paintings and one drawing in the Armory Show of 1913 in New York City. Higgins was elected an academician at the National Academy of Design in 1928. In 1957, the year before he died, the Library of Congress purchased 240 of his etchings.</P>
<P>Higgins's role in this exhibition is essentially epilogic, but no less pertinent for that reason. His first impulse to paint allegedly came at the age of twelve when he read an inspiring article on Millet. Although Rembrandt would eventually displace Millet as Higgins's true idol, the subjects that were to occupy the Missourian's art for most of his long life were direct descendants of the beleaguered peasants of mid-nineteenth-century France.

"2228","Artist Biography","<p>A native of Boston, Fannie Hillsmith began sketching as a teenager. In 1930, she enrolled in the Boston Museum School, which her grandfather, Frank Hill Smith, had helped found.(1) At the time, first-year students had to draw daily from casts of antique sculpture before being eligible to enroll in painting and drawing classes. However, the following year, Rodney J. Burn and Robin Guthrie from the Slade School in London took charge of the curriculum. Under their progressive leadership, students could begin to draw from life after spending a month or two drawing from antique sculpture. Despite this freer academic regime, Hillsmith encountered European modernism onlyafter she completed the four-year course in Boston and spent a year in New York at the Art Students League. Her teachers at the league, Alexander Brook, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, John Sloan, and William Zorach, augmented her earlier academic training. But it was from contact with Vaclav Vytlacil, other progressive New York artists, and especially her study of Albert Gallatin's collection at the Gallery of Living Art, that Hillsmith was drawn to vanguard ideas. Paul Klee's paintings made a special impression on her, and by the late 1930s, Hillsmith began incorporating lyrical line and simplified, childlike forms into her own work.</p><p>The mid 1940s marked Hillsmith's emergence as an exhibiting artist. In 1943, she had her first solo exhibition at Jimmy Ernst's Norlyst Gallery. Peggy Guggenheim featured her work in three exhibitions at Art of This Century shortly thereafter. In 1944, Clement Greenberg singled out her painting <i>Imprisoned</i> [SAAM, 1986.92.57] as "perhaps the best thing" in Guggenheim's Spring Salon for Young Artists, a show that also presented work by William Baziotes, Irene Rice Pereira, Robert Motherwell, JacksonPollock, and Richard Pousette-Dart. In the summer of 1945, Josef Albers invited Hillsmith to teach at Black Mountain College. Finally, her inclusion in Sidney Janis's 1944 book, <i>Abstract and Surrealist Art in America,</i> heralded Hillsmith's arrival as a mature painter. In a statement for Janis's book, Hillsmith explained her artistic intentions: "I endeavor to find a personal way to express in painting the basic qualities of nature. I try to combine the structural with the intimate and to secure simplicity by using few colors and shapes, to acquire variation by using these in diverse ways throughout the canvas."(2)</p><p>In 1946, Hillsmith began a four-year association with Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17. She worked beside Joan Mir&oacute;, Yves Tanguy, Jacques Lipchitz, and other &eacute;migr&eacute;s from war-torn Europe at the studio. Along with developing expertise in the techniques of printing, Hillsmith turned increasingly to the fractured space of Cubism, drawing particularly from the work of Juan Gris. Increasingly, Hillsmith used Cubist elements to create emotional effects, and after 1950, nostalgia, dreams, and interior realities became her primary concerns. "I am interested in abstract art, but I am also interested in the message&mdash;the problem is to convey feeling with the impact of the abstract."(3)</p><p>During the 1960s, Hillsmith began making constructions, an interest that grew out of the toys and jewelry she made during World War II to supplement her income. In the constructions and assemblages she first undertook in the 1970s, the dream world of her paintings takes three-dimensional form. Reminiscent of doll houses, the boxes contain tiny ceramic furniture; walls are sometimes transparent, and Hillsmith uses mirrors to disorient the viewer. The surreal overtones of these recent works, coupled with the disjunctive approach to space, are culminations of Hillsmith's longstanding ability to use Cubist formal elements to psychologically provocative ends.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"1799","Artist Biography","<p>Robert Swain Gifford received his first instruction in drawing during the late 1850s from Albert van Beest and William Bradford at New Bedford, Massachusetts. Later, Walton Richetson, a New Bedford sculptor, shared his studio with Gifford. In 1864 Gifford opened a studio in Boston, but in 1866 settled in New York City. One year later, he was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design and was made a full academician in 1878. In 1869 he sketched in Washington, Oregon, and California, and in 1870 made an extensive trip abroad, visiting England, France, Spain, Italy, Morocco, and Egypt. Four years later, he made a similar journey that included Corsica, Algeria, and parts of North Africa seldom visited by tourists. About ten years later, he returned for a third visit to the Middle East.</p><p>After this, Gifford divided his time between his New York studio and his summer home at Nonquitt, Massachusetts, with the exception of a three month voyage to Alaska in 1899 with a scientific party led by E. H. Harriman. Beginning in 1877 and for nearly thirty years thereafter, he taught art classes at the Cooper Union School in New York. Gifford won medals at the Centennial Exposition of 1876 in Philadelphia, at the Universal Exposition of 1889 in Paris, at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo, and at the Charleston Exposition of 1902. One of the earliest Americans to take up the technique of etching, Gifford helped to establish the New York Etching Club in 1877.</p><p>Born on a small New England island under the most difficult cirumstances (seven of his ten siblings died in childhood), Gifford's early paintings, which featured dramatic seascapes with storm-tossed boats, reflected his natural respect for this subject as well as his lessons with the Dutch painter van Beest. During his second trip abroad in 1874, Gifford visited the art museum in Marseille, whose "fine collection of modern French paintings" may have reinforced his admiration for the Barbizon artists he had first seen in Boston several years before.  Within a few years after his return, Gifford's style was largely purged of his previously overblown romanticism, which was replaced by stark, simpler compositions, wide spacious vistas, and, most typically, a cold, somber mood drawn from the barren dunes and rugged cedars of the New England coast. The Metropolitan Museum's <I>Near the Coast,</I> variants of which can be found in several other Gifford paintings and etchings, was awarded a $2,500 prize in the first Prize Fund Exhibition held at the American Art Gallery in 1885. In May of 1974, seventy years after his death, Gifford was given a full retrospecitve exhibition by the New Bedford Whaling Museum.</p><p>Peter Bermingham <I>American Art in the Barbizon Mood</I> (Washington, D.C.: National Collection of Fine Arts and Smithsonian Institution Press, 1975)</p>",""

"1809","Artist Biography","<p>Following study at Cooper Union and the San Francisco Art Institute, in 1962 Gillespie went to Italy where he lived for the next eight years. The small, visionary landscapes and fantasies he did there incorporate elements of Flemish realism with touches of Surrealism, Italianate religiosity, and Germanic melancholia, and often depict figures engaged in disquieting confrontations. Gillespie describes the work of these years as "soaked with the textures of Italy&#8211;the feelings, the colors." These works combine traditional techniques (underpainting, glazing, and three-point perspective) with overpainted or partially scratched out collage elements in a way that enhances the ambiguity of the imagery. On his return to the United States in 1970 Gillespie began working from life. His recent still lifes, studies of landscape and vegetation, and self-portraits are meticulously painted, yet they also contain disturbing metaphysical presences that are consonant with Gillespie's Italian phase.</p><p>Virginia M.

"1856","Artist Biography","<p>Maurice Golubov first studied art as a teenager during evening classes with John Sloan at a Hebrew Educational Society settlement house.(1) At age fifteen Golubov dropped out of school and apprenticed himself to a fashion studio where he copied figure illustrations. A chance encounter with Mark Tobey, who also worked as a fashion illustrator, introduced Golubov to the National Academy of Design. There, Golubov spent week nights for four years studying with Ivan Olinsky, Charles Curran, and George L. Nelson. In 1922, his mastery of the academic regime was recognized when he received the Suydam Silver Medal for excellence in life drawing.</p><p>In the spring of 1923 Golubov left both the commercial studio and the academy. Although he had not yet encountered vanguard European, or even American art, Golubov was already making abstract geometric designs. He first visited theMetropolitan Museum of Art in the winter of 1923&#150;24, studying Venetian and Flemish painting and glazing techniques. He was also studying Greek, Neoplatonic, and American Transcendentalist philosophy at the public library while he painted at night.</p><p>With funds running short, Golubov returned to commercial art in 1924. At first full-time, his position eventually becameseasonal, allowing him to paint for months at a time. By the late 1920s, he had discovered other New York museums. Kandinsky and Picasso joined C&#233;zanne on his roster of revered masters. During the late 1920s, he determined to break from commercial work to concentrate full time on painting. He became friendly with a number of other  artists&#151;Max Weber, Raphael  Soyer,Stuart Davis, Byron Browne, and Arshile Gorky. The summer of 1928 proved a turning point. Working in Woodstock, where he met Milton Avery and David Smith, Golubov began bringing compositional organization to his abstract experiments. Back in the city at theend of the summer, he brought a greater sense of confidence to his work and began attending meetings at the John Reed Club.(2)</p><p>In 1933, when his savings ran out, Golubov returned to full-time commercial work, though it left him little time to paint. The same year he married. During slow periods at work, he began doing miniatures in gouache and watercolor, which were often later worked out full-size. By the late 1930s, Golubov began spending his summers in Rockport, Massachusetts, and his winters in the city. He continued to move between abstraction and figuration. During thesummers, his oils were frequently figurative, while his abstract canvases, with loose grid structures, dark colors, and expressionist surfaces, were done primarily during the winter months in New York.</p><p>In late 1939, Golubov found a seasonal job at Vogue Wright Studios. At Vogue Wright, he worked long hours for several months and then took off about six months for painting. He continued this arrangement until his retirement in 1967. In 1941, Golubov had a solo exhibition at the Artists' Gallery. Alice T. Mason and George L.K. Morris saw the show and invited Golubov to join the American Abstract Artists. Finally he began showing with the group in 1944.</p><p>By the late 1940s, most of Golubov's work was abstract. He continued to exhibit at the Artists' Gallery, as well as in groupexhibitions at the Walker Art Center, the Jewish Museum, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. In 1943 and 1952, he had solo shows at the Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. Even at this point, however, he had not completely relinquished figuration. In 1962 Golubov's work was featured in <i>Recent Painting USA: The Figure</i> at the Museum of Modern Art.</p><p>Although Golubov's abstractions began as experiments in design, he came to see them as a form of mental rather than visual realism. He grew up in a Hasidic household and as a child began studies toward a rabbinical education. Thus he was grounded in mysticism from an early age, and from his teenage years Golubov was captivated by the world of philosophy. He read Spinoza, Schopenhauer, Kant, Fichte, Berkeley, and Emerson, which along with Eastern philosophy and medieval Jewish theology, provided a basis for his philosophy of art. I could sense and feel more closely the things I felt were real and yet unseen. I didn't feel comfortable trying to express these in words, however; instead, I started to find symbolic means to be able to represent them pictorially." In his abstractions, Golubov sought to express the complexities of the world, a "world where endless moments are arrested into one whole 'instant' moment."(3)</p><p>Golubov came late to the American Abstract Artists. The pressing discussions over the social relevance of abstraction, and the heated arguments over political issues were, by the mid 1940s, in the past. An admirer of Picasso, Kandinsky, and C&eacute;anne, Golubov recognized, but did not take to heart, the stylistic accomplishments of his European prototypes. While his work did pass through stages, and he developed a theory of dimensional space, Golubov looked to himself, not to others for the inspiration, and the means, to express the mystical, the magical, and the profound beauties of life.</p><br /><br /><p>1. Golubov experienced a very difficult childhood. His father immigrated to the United States after his precarious shoemaking business failed. As World War I approached in Russia, his mother decided to leave with her six children. Golubov became separated from the rest of the family, and roamed for several months with a band of children who survived by raiding small farms. Golubov was eventually reunited with the family in Petrograd. The family finally made its way to New York. For this and other information about Golubov's life and career, see Daniel J. Cameron, ed., <i>Maurice Golubov, Paintings 1925&ndash;1980</i> (Charlotte, N.C.: Mint Museum Department of Art, 1980)</p><p>2. At the John Reed Club, Golubov met Moses Soyer, Ad Reinhardt, Saul and Eugenie Baizerman, William Zorach, and others. Although Golubov has frequently been described as an isolated figure, he was friendly with a number of other artists,including Lee Gatch, Reginald Marsh, Louis Lozowick, Jackson Pollock, Hans Hofmann, Theodore Stamos, Theodore Roszak, and others. And, if he didn't show with great frequency, his exposure was not significantly different from the other abstract artists during the 1930s and 1940s.</p> <p>3.

Taken to Goodridge's studio by a mutual friend, Stuart was impressed with her work and invited her to visit his own studio.

"1904","Artist Biography","<p>When he was twelve, Dwinell Grant began studying landscape painting with his grandfather. Seeking further traditionaltraining, in 1931 Grant enrolled at the Dayton Art Institute, which he soon discovered had modernist leanings. After a year, he left Dayton to go to New York where he entered the National Academy of Design in 1933. By the time he arrived in New York, he had seen the Bliss collection and had begun thinking along modern lines. Although at the time, he said, his painting had not yet progressed "beyond the pointillist stage." After five months, he left the National Academy and in 1935 became an instructor in art and director of dramatics at Wittenberg College in Ohio. By this time, Grant's paintings were nonobjective, and he had come to believe that nonobjectivism "is a part of the earth itself. &#133; In creating it we do not say something about something else, but rather we produce a rhythm which is a part of nature's rhythm and just as deep and fundamental as a heartbeat, a thunderstorm, the sequence of day and night or the growth of a girl into womanhood. . . . Nature is not something to be commented on, it is something to be."(1)</p><p>At Wittenberg, Grant had little time to paint. His work with student dramatics provided an outlet for his innovative ideas. As the stage set for an experimental, symphonic drama, Grant designed and built a large, nonobjective construction, painted it gray, then lit it with colored lights controlled by dimmer switches. By varying the intensity of the lights, he found he could change the color, and therefore the mood, of the dramatic presentation.(2) Although Grant's avant-garde ideas soon brought him criticism at Wittenberg, his friends at the Dayton Art Institute encouraged his work, and suggested he write to Hilla Rebay at the Guggenheim Foundation for support.</p><p>Rebay quickly became enthusiastic about Grant's ideas and began sending him a fifteen dollar monthly stipend to help with the cost of materials. She arranged for Solomon Guggenheim to buy two of his drawings, and used several of his paintings in a group exhibition at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting in the summer of 1940.</p><p>The Constructivist stage set hadtransformed Grant's ambitions, and he yearned to make an experimental, nonobjective film. He wrote to Rebay, "I am no prophet. I am simply an artist who sees a neglected beauty that is bursting to be possessed. In the midst of the confusion of nationalistic isms here will be an art that is clean, naked and straightforward. Itwill be barbaric because it will have none of the sickening stupid veneer that civilization has laid on the arts for hundreds of years, but it will not be crude. And it will drive in to the emotions a new depth because of the primitiveness, the directness, and the fundamentalness of its expression."(3)</p><p>With Rebay's assistance, Grant moved to New York and began working at theGuggenheim. His own art flourished, andbetween 1938 and 1941, he made several experimental films, including "Contrathemis," an eight-minute, animated production, for which he did some four thousand drawings. In 1942, Grant went to work for a commercial film company and during World War II made navy training films. Soon thereafter, he began doing scientific illustration and making teaching films for the medical profession. Although he continued to paint and draw independently, his career in medical films took precedence, and until the mid 1970s, he exhibited his creative work only on rare occasions.</p><p>In New York in the early 1940s, Grant was friendly with John Sennhauser, Jean Xceron, Irene Rice Pereira, and others associated with the Guggenheim Foundation. However, he did not become actively involved with either the American Abstract Artists or other organizations that provided an artistic or political forum for practicing artists. His own vision had developed independently, and although his paintings bear some resemblance to those of Kandinsky, his interest in balance and rhythm grew intuitively rather than as the result of a theoretical searching for new forms of expression.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"1910","Artist Biography","<p>A prot&eacute;g&eacute; and close friend of Mark Tobey, Graves grew up in the Northwest and for many years made his home on an island in Puget Sound. Although he never received any formal artistic training (he didn't complete high school until age twenty-two), in 1932 he encountered Guy Anderson, a highly trained artist with whom he shared a studio. During the late 1930s Graves worked intermittently for the Federal Art Project and met Tobey, who became a friend and mentor and, along with experimental composer John Cage, helped nurture Graves's early interest in Oriental philosophy and religion. Protective of his solitude, Graves has lived mostly in remote rural areas, and uses the elements of nature as his subjects. Animals abound in his paintings and birds appear with special frequency, but towards a metaphorical rather than descriptive end. Shunning contact with contemporary industrial life, Graves in the 1960s painted abstractions based on the noises of the machine age with a degree of understanding possible only to one who cherishes quiet.</p><p>Virginia M.

"1930","Artist Biography","<p>Balcomb Greene began his art career only after he married Gertrude Glass in 1926. He had studied philosophy and psychology as a student at Syracuse University, and spent a year doing graduate work in psychology in Vienna. In 1927, the Greenes returned to New York, where Balcomb pursued advanced study in English literature. For the following three years, Greene taught English at Dartmouth College and wrote fiction. After the couple went to Paris for a year late in 1931, Greene began to experiment with painting. He worked independently at the Acad&#233;mie de la Grande Chaumi&#232;re, but beyond this brief exposure to art school, he taught himself by frequenting the caf&eacute;s of Paris and by looking at the new art to be seen in the French capital. He was fascinated with both Picasso and Matisse, but Juan Gris, Piet Mondrian, and the members of the <i>Abstraction-Cr&#233;ation</i> group exercised special influence on Greene's development of a personal, artisticstyle.</p><p>In Paris, Greene quickly developed an acute analytical sense for modernism.After he and his wife settled in New York early in 1933, Greene published articles on art in <i>Art Front,</i> the magazine of the Artists' Union, as well as in several other publications. With his wife, he was active in several artists' organizations; in 1935 and 1936 he served as editor of <i>Art Front,</i> and he became the first chairman of the American Abstract Artists, a post to which he was twice reelected. In addition, Greene helped draft the group's charter, served on the editorial committee for the 1938 yearbook, and designed the cover for the first  publication.</p><p>Until the WPA was formed in 1935, Greene made a precarious living writing for two sensationalist newspapers, <i>Broadway Brevities</i> and <i>Graft.</i>(1) After joining the WPA, he painted abstract murals for the Hall of Medicine at the 1939 New York World's Fair and for the Williamsburg Housing Project, and he designed a stained-glass window for a school in the Bronx. About 1940, Greene began working on a master's degree in art history at New York University. In 1942, he accepted a post at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, where he taught art history until 1959. The Pittsburgh move did not mean cutting New York ties for the Greenes. The couple commuted between the two cities, and in 1947 purchased land atMontauk Point, Long Island, where they spent as much time as possible.</p><p>It was not until the 1950s that Greene began to exhibit with any frequency. He had shown his earliest paintings&#151;admixtures of realism, fantasy, and incongruous stylistic elements&#151; in Paris in 1932. His work was featured at J.B. Neumann's New Art Circle in 1947, and in 1950, Greene began exhibiting at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York. By this time his painting had undergone a fairly dramatic stylistic shift. During the 1930s, Greene worked with angular, geometric planes, intersecting and overlaying color to create distinctive spatial configurations. Completely nonobjective, his forms often functioned as objects in space, their perspectives controlled through the juxtaposition of diagonal and rectilinear structure. Greene often worked out compositions by making small paper collages, such as the <i>Untitled</i> works identified as "34&#150;8", "35&#150;4", "35&#150;7", and "39&#150;03". Intended as preparatory studies, these collages  represented a thinking-through process and lack the surface finish that characterized his oils.(2)</p><p>Around 1943, Greene again began using the human figure in his work. Although not conscious of Surrealist influences, Greene's odd merging of geometric space with organically abstracted human figures&#151;evident, for example, in <i>Way Down Blue</i> of 1945&#151; represents a distinctly Surrealist impression.(3) By the late 1940s, Greene began a clear transition to the figurative style for which he is now well known. Light entered his work as an abstract compositional device, as did a desire to reflect fundamental humanist concerns.  Beyond his involvement in artists' groups and his own paintings, Greene contributed significantly to the modernist cause through his eloquent and perceptive essays. He believed that the artist had a special gift for speaking directly to the individual:</p><p>It is actually the artist, and only he, who is equipped for approaching the individual directly. The abstract artist can approach man through the most immediate of aesthetic experiences, touching below consciousness and the veneer of attitudes, contacting the whole ego rather than the ego on the defensive."(4)</p><p>He also argued specifically for a new language in art:</p><p>: "Without denying that [the artist's] ultimate aim is to touch the crowd, he sees the futility of addressing it in the language commonly used by the crowd. He must employ his own language &#133; in order to move, dominate and direct the crowd, which is his especial way of being understood. &#133; The point in abstractionism, actually, is that the function of art and the means of achieving this function have been for the first time made inseparable."(5)</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"1931","Artist Biography","<p>A political leftist and social activist, Gertrude Greene avoided overt commentary in her art. Unlike Louis Schanker, Hananiah Harari, and others for whom art expressed societal concerns, natural forms, and structures, Greene looked to the purity of Mondrian and Russian Constructivists Antoine Pevsner, Naum Gabo, and Vladimir Tatlin for her artistic foundations.</p><p>Greene began studying sculpture at the Leonardo da Vinci School in NewYork in 1924. The curriculum at the Leonardo school paralleled the foundation classes at the National Academy of Design and other conservative art schools&#151;students studied life drawing only after demonstrating proficiency in drawing from plaster casts. Greene's art interests carried over into the kindergarten she ran at the time; on rainy days, she took her young charges to the Brooklyn Museum where the students attempted to draw the sculpture and paintings.(1)</p><p>In 1926, Greene, n&#233;e Glass, married Balcomb Greene. The young couple soon left for Vienna where Balcomb pursued graduate work in psychology. After a year abroad, they returned to New York via Paris, and in 1928, Balcomb accepted a teaching position at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. During their three years in New Hampshire, the Greenes visited New York often. They frequented Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art and the newly opened Museum of Modern Art. This whetted Greene's appetite to see more vanguard art, and by late 1931, the couple had saved enough money to return to Paris.</p><p>Paris in the late 1920s and early 1930s offered remarkable opportunities for young artists seeking the avant-garde. Not only was the city the center for Cubism and Surrealism, but, with the formation of <i>Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation,  Art Nonfiguratif,</i> Constructivism was very much in evidence. The goal of this group, wrote sculptor Naum Gabo in the first issue of the eponymous publication, was the "cultivation of pure plastic art, to the exclusion of all explanatory, anecdotal, literary and naturalistic elements."</p><p>Greene, especially, became fascinated with the Constructivists, ideas about unifying art and politics&#151;thoughts that grew out of their belief that when "purified," art would show the way for reordering society along higher planes. Even more than the theory, however, Greene was impressed with Pevsner's and Gabo's art, and began doing Constructivist drawings. After the Greenes returned to New York, Gertrude became active in leftist artists' organizations. She helped establish the Unemployed Artists' Group that was formed to lobby for federal support for unemployed painters, sculptors, and printmakers.</p><p>Throughout  the 1930s, Greene's art progressed almost systematically toward geometrical purity. By 1935, the year the Museum of Modern Art presented excellent examples of work by Malevich, El Lissitzky, Rodchenko, Tatlin, and Pevsner in an exhibition entitled <i>Cubism and Abstract Art,</i> she herself had begun making constructions. Initially indicative of herappreciation for Jean Arp's work, Greene'sconstructions over the next two years moved between biomorphic and geometric abstraction. Increasingly, however, she began merging the two types of  forms&#151;one associated with Surrealism, the other with Constructivism&#151;and after about 1940, a simple, geometric approach akin to Neo-plasticism and Constructivism predominated. As studies for these works, she began making paper collages that explored the merging of biomorphic and geometric form and experimented with layering as a spatial device.(2)  <p>In her last constructions, such as <i>Construction 1946,</i> Greene began adding gestural areas of color. Although among her strongest and most original accomplishments, she put aside her relief constructions in favor of painting. Initially geometric, her paintings by the early 1950s became increasingly expressionistic. Her solo exhibitions, in 1951 and 1955, the first of her career, included only the late, gestural canvases.</p><p>In 1937, when the American Abstract Artists was formed, Greene was its first paid employee. She tended the desk at the Squibb Gallery exhibition in 1937, passing out questionnaires and answering the queries and jibes about the art that was featured in the first annual show. Her own work was also shown that year in the opening exhibition of the Museum of Non-Objective Painting.</p><p>Although she resigned her membership in the American Abstract Artists in 1942, only five years after the first exhibition, Greene did so in the belief that the group's mission had been largely accomplished. She had figured prominently in the group's programs and in promoting the purist point of view in arguments over the role of nature versus geometric purity in abstract art.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"1935","Artist Biography","<p>Horatio Greenough was the first American to make sculpture his profession and to gain international recognition thereby. He was born in Boston and began his career copying casts of classical sculptures at the Boston Athenaeum. His friendship with Washington Allston, begun while at Harvard, influenced his career and his thought. After graduating from Harvard in 1824, Greenough went to Carrara and later settled in Florence, where he and James Fenimore Cooper became close friends. Through the influence of Allston and Daniel Webster, in 1832 Greenough was given the first important commission by the U.S. government to an artist, for a statue of George Washington.</p><p>Greenough's religious background seems to have been Unitarian. His family rented a pew in the First Congregational Society, then Unitarian, and he studied at Harvard during the ascendancy of Unitarianism there.</p><p>Greenough's theory and observations were published in The Travels, Observations and Experiences of a Yankee Stonecutter. Most seminal of his theories, especially for later designers and architects, was his principle that "form follows function." In his original statement of the theory it is seen as the Creator's formula: "If there be any principle of structure more plainly inculcated in the works of the Creator than all others, it is, the principle of unflinching adaptation of forms to functions."</p><p>Greenough had an easy, engaging personality and was a part of the intellectual and artistic life of whatever place he lived, whether Boston, Florence, or Rome.

"1960","Artist Biography","<P>Chaim Gross (1904 Austria–1991 USA) will always be remembered as one of the foremost American sculptors who practiced direct carving in wood. This installation of graphic works and sculptures in wood and bronze, executed between 1932 and 1976, celebrates his long, prolific career and the beneficent gift of his <I>Acrobatic Performers</I> from the Renee and Chaim Gross Foundation.</P>
<P>Born in the Carpathian Mountains in Austrian Galicia, Gross was the son of a lumber merchant. He displayed an interest in drawing at an early age and throughout his life produced a prodigious number of graphic works, many of which were preparatory studies for his sculptures. After a turbulent nomadic existence caused by World War I, Gross immigrated to New York City in 1921. He first studied drawing in night classes at the Educational Alliance art school while working during the day as a delivery boy.</P>
<P>A friend's remark that Gross's drawings had a very sculptural quality provided the impetus to study this medium at the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, where he was briefly taught by Elie Nadelman. In 1927 he attended the Art Students League, receiving only two months of instruction in direct carving from Robert Laurent. That same year he quit his job in order to concentrate on art and to begin a teaching career in sculpture at the Educational Alliance, which would continue until 1989. In 1932, in the midst of the Depression, Gross had his first solo exhibition at The Gallery 144 in New York. Like many other artists, he benefited greatly from the support of the New Deal's Public Works of Art Project. In the late 1930s the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture commissioned him to execute several works for federal buildings; these helped to establish him as a major contemporary sculptor.</P>
<P>Gross gained renown as an advocate of direct carving. Between 1926 and 1949, seventy-five percent of his works were in wood and ten percent in stone. Although he used hand tools exclusively, he preferred the hardest woods, particularly those with a dark color or pronounced grain. In contrast, however, he favored soft but colorful stone. His sculptures were predominantly totemic, figurative images of women. The human body became a source of abstract invention in which Gross simplified forms to stress dynamic rhythms; realism was secondary. Every carving represented a synthesis of form and medium. He distorted forms to retain the cylindrical sensation of the block of wood. A sense of compression in the shapes infused them with an expansiveness and a monumentality.</P>
<P>After World War II, Gross began to explore different subjects and techniques. The loss of family members in the Holocaust provoked an interest in Judaic subject matter. By 1957, sculptures modeled in plaster on an armature for casting in bronze began to outnumber his direct carvings. In contrast to his carvings, the bronzes revealed a new freedom to extend forms into space and incorporate space into his compositions. In building up the plasters, he utilized carving techniques that contributed to the angular forms characteristic of his bronzes.</P>
<P>For more than sixty years Chaim Gross's art has expressed optimistic, affirming themes. His acrobats, cyclists, and mothers and children convey joyfulness, exuberance, love, and intimacy. This aspect of his work remained consistent with his Hasidic heritage, which teaches that "only in his childlike happiness is man nearest to God."</P>

"1966","Artist Biography","<p>Grossman completed a fine arts degree at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and subsequently received a Guggenheim fellowship for travel abroad. Although initially influenced by Richard Lindner and David Smith, Grossman's paintings, collages, and sculpture come out of a distinctly individual understanding of the psychological reality of contemporary life. Concerned with people as victims, Grossman depicted headless human forms tightly bound with shackles in a series of drawings, and in collages created figures whose contorted postures and featureless faces convey an unidentifiable sense of panic. In the late 1960s Grossman began her well-known series of carved wooden heads. Covered with leather, they often have closed zippers for mouths and are adorned with horns, buttons, or metal studs. In these sculptures Grossman symbolizes repression and the bestial side of human nature.</p><p>Virginia M.

"1967","Artist Biography","<P>George Grosz studied art at the Kunstgewerbeschule in his native Berlin and at the Kunstakademie in Dresden. He spent a summer in Paris, but his enlistment in the German army during World War I curtailed further work abroad. Grosz's army experience proved psychologically devastating. He was horrified at the immorality and greed he saw, and in 1918 joined the German Communist Party (KDP). Soon disillusioned, he nevertheless remained a member of the politically active German Dada movement. Arrested several times by the German authorities for publishing antigovernment and anticlerical drawings during the 1920s, Grosz immediately accepted an offer to teach at the Art Students League in New York. In the United States in the 1930s, Grosz continued to employ the bitter satire of his Dada years, although his work took a brief turn toward tranquility (before World War II again threatened world stability). During the 1930s and 1940s, through the influence of Grosz and Karl Zerbe, an important strain of American Expressionism developed. Although he never returned to live in his native Germany, Grosz was elected to the Akademie der Kunst in Berlin in 1958 and died while visiting there the following year.</P>

"2017","Artist Biography","<p>John Valentine Haidt was born in Germany and began his artistic career when forty-five or forty-six years of age in the Moravian community of Herrnhaag. His father, a goldsmith, taught him this trade, though the boy wanted to become a minister. However, he studied drawing for three years at the Royal Academy of Arts in Berlin. Later, when established in London as a goldsmith, he joined the Moravians after a profound religious experience at a Moravian love feast in London. He became a lay preacher in England, then returned to Germany in 1746.</p><p>His motivation for devoting himself entirely to painting came when the Moravian church was going through the so-called Sifting Period. Haidt, who was impressed by the Moravian emphasis on the blood and wounds of the Saviour, felt that the Moravians were straying from the true gospel. Thus, he wrote Count Zinzendorf and asked to be allowed to paint rather than preach, saying, "For, I thought, if they will not preach the martyrdom of God anymore, l will paint it all the more vigorously." Permission was granted and Count Zinzendorf, who had already asked him to do one painting, increased the request to nine. In 1754 he left England with his family for Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, then the center of the Moravian church in this country. In the communal economic system of the Moravians there was no such thing as a non-religious occupation. The church supported him, even providing him with a painting room. As official church painter, he did not have to get commissions from congregations or individuals. He painted portraits as well as many Biblical scenes, and indeed was very productive. He concluded his memoir in 1767 with the words, "I hardly need to mention that I have painted, because almost all the congregations have some of my work, which the dear Savior has also let be a blessing to many a heart."</p><p>Haidt's paintings were intended, as Walter Peters writes, "literally as visual aids in expounding the Scriptures not only in Moravian churches but also in Moravian mission chapels among the Indian nations and other mission fields." Though Haidt did portraits, a large group of the extant paintings are preponderantly on Passion subjects; there are several versions of the Crucifixion, Christ in Gethsemane, the Ecce Homo, and Lamentation over the Dead Christ. All of these emphasize the blood and sweat and anguish of Christ, recalling the 'incomparable hymn' by Count Zinzendorf which moved Haidt at the time of his conversion: "The Savior's blood and righteousness / Our beauty is, our glorious dress; / Thus well arrayed we need not fear, / When in His presence we appear."</p><p>Today many of Haidt's paintings are on view at the Moravian Historical Society in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, and at the Archives of the Moravian Church in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Jane Dillenberger and Joshua C.

"2052","Artist Biography","<P>The artistic gifts of James Hampton were virtually unknown until shortly after his death. Hampton was born in the small rural community of Elloree, South Carolina. His father was an itinerant, self-proclaimed Baptist minister and gospel singer who deserted his wife and four young children to follow his calling.</P>
<P>When Hampton was around nineteen years old he moved to Washington, D.C., to join an older brother. From 1939 to 1942 Hampton worked as a short-order cook in several local cafes, and later joined the federal government labor force. Details concerning Hampton's educational background are sketchy. Presumably he attended the local schools in Elloree, South Carolina. On an application for federal employment in Washington, Hampton claimed to have attended an African-American high school in the District of Columbia through the tenth grade. There are no records, however, of Hampton's attendance at such a school.</P>
<P>In 1943 Hampton was inducted into the United States Army and served with the 385th Aviation Squadron in Texas, Hawaii, and the jungles of Saipan and Guam. His unit was noncombatant, and drew duties that consisted largely of carpentry and maintenance of air strips. Following his honorable discharge from the army in 1945, Hampton returned to Washington. In 1946 he was hired by the General Services Administration as a janitor. He remained in that position until his death.</P>
<P>Additional facts concerning Hampton's life are scarce. He never married, lived alone in a small apartment in a row house in northwest Washington, and was described as a small, bespectacled, soft-spoken recluse with few friends. James Hampton was totally dedicated to his "vision", a "vision" that almost defies artistic classification yet produced an outstanding example of religious sculpture. In November 1964, Hampton died of cancer in Washington at the age of fifty-three.</P>

"2066","Artist Biography","<P>A native of Rochester, NewYork, Harari began to paint while still a teenager. He studied first at the Rochester Memorial Art Gallery, and from 1930 to 1932 at the School of Fine Arts at Syracuse University. In Paris in 1932, he studied with Fernand Léger, André Lhote, and Marcel Grommaire. Through portraitcommissions Harari was able to extend his stay on the city's Left Bank for several years. In Paris, Harari sought out Impressionist and Old Master paintings as well as modern works. He spent a year doing copy drawings from the collections of the Louvre. After a trip to Palestine, "where visual richness but little hard cash awaited him," he returned to the United States in 1935. Harari settled in New York City, and joined the circle of young abstractionists working on the WPA's mural project under Burgoyne Diller. For Harari, as for a host of others, the WPA experience provided unencumbered time to develop their art "in an environment of purpose and animation. . . ."(1)</P>
<P>After returning to New York, Harari became involved in the vanguard circle of the American Abstract Artists. Never a doctrinaire abstractionist, even in the early years of his career, Harari moved freely between abstraction and a lyrical expressionism that incorporated figurative elements. This is apparent in his <I>Sparklers on the Fourth</I> [SAAM, 1986.92.55] and <I>Jacob Wrestling with the Angel</I> [SAAM, 1986.92.52]. Harari was unwilling to relinquish the rich possibilities the natural world offered. Moreover, the strict avoidance of recognizable forms advanced by geometric abstractionist members of the American Abstract Artists (Ad Reinhardt for one), precluded expression of Harari's irrepressible wit. Their approach, he wrote, "denied too much of art's potential and too many of its glories; in elevating neatness and order to a high altar, it failed to give adequate weight to the enriching concept of random upset (disorder, derangement, derailment)—a phenomenon abounding in all of life. I could not accept the idea that a formally pure art in and of itself denoted an evolutionary advance over an art of forms rooted in the natural world; to the contrary, I saw the former not leading forward, but, within its logic, veering toward a void."(2)</P>
<P>Within the American Abstract Artists, Harari was by no means alone in his unwillingness to renounce themes drawn from his experience of the world. In a letter to the editor of <I>Art Front,</I> drafted by Harari, and signed also by George McNeil, Byron Browne, Rosalind Bengelsdorf, Leo Lances, Herzl Emanuel, and Jan Matulka, the group declared: "It is our very definite belief that abstract art forms are not separated from life, but on the contrary are great realities, manifestations of a search into the world. …"(3) This desire to connect with the world at large is apparent not only in Harari's paintings but also in various letters to editors he wrote during this first decade of his career.(4) Social and political concerns, and a desire to educate those unfamiliar with modern art, color his philosophy about art's significance and potential. Several paintings from the late 1930s and early 1940s reflect his horror at the political oppression and social atrocities takingplace in Germany.</P>
<P>Around 1939, Harari became fascinated with William Harnett, and began doing <I>trompe l'oeil</I> paintings. Several of these he also executed according to a Cubist vocabulary. A 1939 painting entitled <I>Man's Boudoir</I>, a <I>trompe l'oeil</I> painting of a table top with the accoutrements of a man's toilette that won the first Hallgarten Prize at the National Academy of Design's 1942 annual exhibition, has, as a pendant, a Cubist version of the same subject.(5)</P>
<P>Throughout Harari's work there is whimsy and wit, and an abiding desire to express a <I>joie de vivre.</I> <I>Sparklers on the Fourth</I> was made from sketches done during the summer of 1940 when Harari, his wife, and several friends were celebration Independence Day. "It was a mild night. The national flag was raised in the center of the lawn. The brilliant lights of the pyrotechnics pierced the darkness and illuminated the flag and my companions, who, abandoned themselves to the occasion and engaged themselves in running spontaneously about while holding the blazing sparklers in their hands, thus etching streaks of light against the night. . . . This scene had in it magic and beauty. . . ."(6) In the painting, Harari captures the light that pierced the dusky night. Laying dark pigment over a white ground, he etched into the painting's surface, using the whiteness of the ground to illuminate the nocturnal scene.</P>
<P>In 1943, Harari was inducted into the army, and at that time he ended his association with the American Abstract Artists. An active, early member of the group, Harari's artistic interests after the war no longer coincided with the group's program.</P>

His work was first exhibited in New York in 1933 at the Julian Levy Gallery and subsequently was represented in the annuals of the Whitney Museum of American Art. During the 1930s he worked for the Index of American Design, a division of the WPA Federal Art Project, documenting Victorian interiors with a satirical edge that captured the era's overblown décor.

"2099","Artist Biography","<P>Born in Lewiston, Maine, Hartley embarked on a lifelong search for family after his own dissolved in his youth with the early death of his mother and his father's remarriage. When Hartley was twelve years old, his father and stepmother left the boy with his older sister for four years. He was an introspective and isolated child, and these traits, in addition to his homosexuality, were a source of tension all his life.</P>
<P>Hartley's attachment to the landscape of Maine was an important element of his painting career. Simultaneously attracted and depressed by the scenery, he returned every summer during the years he studied in New York (first with William Merritt Chase and then at the less expensive National Academy of Design) and lived there with his father and stepmother during his twenties and thirties. Hartley's early pictures, aggressively brushed impressionist landscapes painted in North Lovell, reveal his efforts of find his own style.</P>
<P>His first critical success came with an exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz's 291 Gallery in New York in 1909. Subsequent years were spent painting in Europe, New York, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Mexico, Bermuda, and Nova Scotia. At the end of his career, Hartley returned to Maine, whose wild landscape he considered unique and whose people, he believed, "practiced values of directness and trust." His later Maine paintings were to some dregree a means of resolving his artistic and personal struggles. He invested the landscape, particularly Mount Katahdin and the shore, with a spiritual significance informed by his belief in the transcendentalism of Whitman and Emerson. He experienced a degree of success in the early 1940s, when several museums acquired his work.</P>

In 1899 he moved to New York, studying first under William Merritt Chase and F. Luis Mora and the next year at the National Academy of Design. With financial assistance from Alfred Stieglitz, Hartley went to Europe in 1912, spending much of his time in Germany, where he met Wassily Kandinsky, Franz Marc, and other members of the Blaue Reiter group.</P>
<P>On the advice of Charles L. Daniel, a gallery owner who had earlier sponsored Paul Burlin's stay in New Mexico, Hartley visited Taos and Santa Fe in 1918 and 1919. He was attracted by the landscape, which he thought "magnificent" and "austere," by the primitive simplicity of local <I>santos,</I> and by Indian dances, which he proclaimed the one truly indigenous art form in America.</P>
<P>In the early 1920s, while living in Berlin, Hartley recalled the New Mexican landscape in a series of paintings far more turbulent and brooding than any he had done on location. The next decade he divided his time between Europe and America, but his last years were spent mostly in his native Maine, painting the rugged coastline and "archaic portraits" of local fishermen.</P><BR>

It is telling that the future artist first dabbled with a brush while sitting in the old coach that carried the Marquis de Lafayette through New England on his triumphal tour in 1824&ndash;25! Hassam, like many of his fellow artists, traveled to Europe for instruction in the 1880s and eventually settled in New York. Exposed to the full measure of urban hustle and bustle, Hassam returned to the past as often as he could and during the last forty years of his life traveled from one historic summer resort to the next, painting picturesque villages and towns throughout New England. The past is therefore a living presence in Hassam's art.

"2128","Artist Biography","<p class="noindent">Throughout the early decades of this century, the name Charles Webster Hawthorne was virtually synonymous with the thriving community of painters, sculptors, and writers that gathered each summer in Provincetown, Massachusetts. It was perhaps only natural that Hawthorne should be strongly attracted by this small fishing village on the tip of Cape Cod&mdash;so much of his earlier life had been spent by the sea. Although born in Lodi, Illinois, while his mother was on a visit to her family, he grew up near the ocean in Richmond, Maine. His father worked out of Richmond as a seaman, a captain of the trading ships that plyed the New England coast.</p><p>Despite little evidence of pronounced artistic ambitions during much of his youth, Hawthorne's desire to become a painter led him, in 1890, to leave Maine for New York City. There he supported himself with various jobs while studying nights at the Art Students League with George de Forest Brush and H. Siddons Mowbray, and in the evening classes of Frank Vincent du Mond. In the summer of 1896 he enrolled in Willliam Merritt Chase's summer school and there met his future wife, Ethel Marion Campbell. Hawthorne was quickly recognized as a gifted young painter and became Chase's valued assistant at both Chase's New York school and summer session at Shinnecock, Long Island. These classes were to be the last formal training undertaken by Hawthorne, whose plasn were abruptly changed with Chase's unexpected discontinuation of his school. Following a summer of painting on his own in Holland, he made the bold decision to establish his own summer art school.</p><p>Although other artists had discovered Provincetown some years earlier, the Cape Cod School of Art, opened in 1899, was the town's first formal art school. Hawthorne's strong personality and witty critiques inspired a devoted following, and the school flourished. Salt air and sun in an unspoiled, picturesque setting were very welcome after a demanding, busy winter in New York. Most important Provincetown and its vicinity offered much that was visually appealing to Hawthrone: "nets, boats and tackle &#133;  a jumble of color in the intense sunlight acctentuated by the brillian blue of harbor &#133; dunes [rising] to an imposing height &#133; the small forest of stunted pine and oak, black against the brilliant sand."1 The scenic beauty of the cape continued to fascinate him, and the strong New England types and striking, rugged Portuguese fishermen who had settled in the village were to figure prominently in his work throughout his career. Both painting and teaching seemed to have merged easily in Provincetown, for, with the exception of two summers abroad, he continued to work there until his death in 1930.</p><p>1.

"2130","Artist Biography","<P>By 1940 Palmer Hayden was known for his narrative scenes of New York's urban life and the rural South. Like a photographer taking snapshots, he depicted black subjects during unguarded moments in their daily routine. His characterizations-sometimes humorous, sometimes unflattering-are nonetheless caring and proud. Described by Hayden's compelling use of line, they possess the immediacy of popular illustrations.</P>
<P>Although the artist's studio is a time-honored theme, Hayden's intention in <I>The Janitor Who Paints</I>[SAAM, 1967.57.28] is more provocative than usual because he described it as a "protest painting" in a 1969 interview. An easel, palette, and brushes share space with a bed, nightstand, feather duster, and broom. Is Hayden's subject an amateur, painting portraits of his family and friends in his spare time at home? Or is he a professional artist, forced to support himself in a modest occupation and to combine his creative and domestic spheres in one setting? Having taken odd jobs including housecleaning to support himself, Hayden experienced the economic hardships of many black artists, and the painting has often been interpreted as both a self-portrait and a statement on adversity.</P>
<P>The most immediate source for the element of protest that Hayden associated with the work, however, was his friendship with Cloyd Boykin, an older African-American painter who supported himself as a janitor:"I painted it because no one called Boykin the artist. They called him the janitor." Hayden incorporated details such as the beret and the subject of mother and child to reinforce the sense of artistic identity, while the clock alludes to the workman's schedule.</P>
<P>Initially self-taught, Hayden sought training in New York and Paris, yet his style has frequently been described as primitive. In <I>The Janitor Who Paints,</I> the figures' oversized hands and intense, cartoonlike expressions, as well as the freely treated space in which shapes are outlined as relatively flat areas of color, recall the simplified forms of American folk art. Actually, these elements owe as much to the broader influences of African and modern art that Hayden encountered in Paris as to his highly personal approach to interpreting the vitality and challenges of African-American life.</P>

<P>Palmer Hayden was an artist whose association with the Harlem Renaissance was more spiritual than stylistic. Born on January 15, 1890, in Widewater, Virginia, to Nancy and John Hedgeman, Hayden was christened Peyton Cole Hedgeman but later changed his name to Palmer Hayden, the name he signed on all of his works. Hayden's interest in drawing began during his childhood. His first formal contact with art did not occur, however, until his enlistment in the army during World War I, when he enrolled in a drawing correspondence course. Hayden's military duty took him to West Point and the Philippines. Following his discharge from the army, Hayden moved to New York and worked part-time while studying art with Victor Perard at the Cooper Union School of Art. </P>
<P>During his early years Hayden also studied painting with Asa G. Randall at the Boothbay Art Colony in Maine in 1925. Hayden was awarded a working fellowship to Boothbay, and devoted most of his time to painting boats and marine subjects. His Boothbay period paintings were exhibited in New York in 1926 at the Civic Club and won two Harmon Foundation awards—the coveted gold medal and a cash prize of $400. With this money and a personal contribution from a patron, Hayden sailed for Paris in 1927, and studied in Brittany and in Paris at the École des Beaux Arts. Within a year Hayden had distinguished himself and mounted a one-man show at the Galerie Bernheim in Paris in November 1928. He also exhibited in group shows in Paris at the Salon des Tuileries in 1930 and the American Legion Exhibition in 1931. Hayden's portrayal of African-American subject matter in many of his paintings in the latter show was unusual in Paris at that time.</P>
<P>Hayden was in Paris during the final years of the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, but he had lived in New York during the formative years of that pivotal period. He knew Harlem Renaissance artists and shared their efforts, triumphs, and frustrations. Hayden maintained close contact with the Harmon Foundation while in the United States, and exhibited annually in the Harmon Foundation shows from 1928 to 1932 when he was in Paris.</P>
<P>Although Hayden received thorough academic training in New York, Maine, and Paris, his works always retained a flat naive character, which he developed independently during his youth. One of Hayden's best-known early works is <I>Fétiche et Fleurs</I> of 1926, which clearly linked Hayden with the African-Cubist tradition of Harlem and Paris. The small still-life composition depicts a vase of lilies, an ashtray, and a Gabonese Fang head on a table covered with a Kuba textile from Zaire. This painting was one of the earliest by an African-American artist to incorporate actual African imagery, and was awarded Mrs. John D. Rockefeller's prize for painting in the Harmon Show of 1933.</P>
<P>Following his return from Paris in 1932, Hayden worked on the United States Treasury Art Project and the W.P.A. Art Project from 1934 to 1940, and painted scenes of the New York waterfront and other local subjects. During the late 1930s Hayden developed a consciously naive style, which represented various aspects of African-American life. One of the first paintings that heralded Hayden's new style was <I>Midsummer Night in Harlem,</I> 1938, in which he effectively evoked the mood of Harlem's residents congregating outside to escape the heat inside the tenements. Despite the flat forms and stylized figures, the compositional arrangement and treatment of perspective reveal Hayden's academic training. African-American art historian James Porter apparently misunderstood Hayden's objectives when he criticized <I>Midsummer Night in Harlem</I> as a talent gone astray," and compared the painting to "one of those billboards that once were plastered on public buildings to advertise black face minstrels." Hayden insisted, however, that he was not striving for satirical effects in his African-American folk paintings, but that he wanted to achieve a new type of expression.</P>
<P>In 1944 Hayden began painting the <I>Ballad of John Henry</I> series that would occupy him for the next ten years. The series comprises a group of twelve paintings depicting scenes from the life of the legendary African-American folk hero who inspired the ballad named after him. An exhibition of these paintings and others dealing with African-American folklore was held at the Countee Cullen Library in Harlem in 1952. Hayden was also represented in the large exhibition, The Evolution of the Afro-American Artist, sponsored by the City University of New York, the Urban League, and the Harlem Cultural Council and presented in the fall of 1967 in the great hall of the City University. From the late 1960s until his death in 1973, Hayden continued to paint subjects based on African-American themes, but in a more cosmopolitan manner than his earlier works.</P>

"2161","Artist Biography","<p>Of the Europeans who exerted firsthand influence on American abstract artists of the 1930s, H&eacute;lion is among the most significant. A Frenchman who studied chemistry and architecture before taking up painting, H&eacute;lion's involvement in artists groups dates from the late 1920s. He was a founding member of <i>Art Concret</i> and played a prominent role in <i>Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation.</i> Moreover, he helped (with his fluent command of English) to bring Americans working in Paris during the early 1930s together with the continental artists who were influential in shaping European modernism.</p><p>H&#233;lion and Jean Xceron becamefriends as early as 1929. The association began after Xceron wrote an article about H&eacute;lion for the Paris edition of the<i>Chicago Tribune.</i> Xceron summarized H&#233;lion's view that art should correspond with the mechanical and industrial age.</p><p>In 1932, on the occasion of his marriage to an American, H&#233;lion first visited the United States. Although the couple settled near his wife's family in Virginia, H&#233;lion paid frequent visits to New York. As a leading, if still youthful, member of the Parisian vanguard, H&#233;lion exhibited in New York with increasing regularity over the next ten years. Between visits to Europe, H&#233;lion encouraged Carl Holty, Harry Holtzman, and George L.K. Morris to form an artists' group, and his third extended trip to New York during the winter of 1936&ndash;37 coincided with the formal organization of the American Abstract Artists.</p><p>H&#233;lion became especially well known for his close knowledge of European art and his articulate views on abstraction. He wrote regularly for advanced art magazines, served as editor of the first five issues of the <i>Abstraction-Cr&#233;ation</i> journal, played a significant role in the British publication <i>Axis,</i> and wrote, or edited, major portions of the 1933 catalogue for Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art. More than most artists, H&eacute;lion's attachments were broad. He was friendly with School of Paris artists, yet maintained close contacts with Dutch, Russian, and British movements as well. But it was New York that held the greatest fascination for him. For H&#233;lion, it was the only city that had a true modern spirit, and when he came in 1936, he intended to remain. Yet in January 1940, four months before the Nazis conquered France, he left to join the French army. Six months later H&eacute;lion was taken prisoner and interned in a camp near the Polish border. After a dramatic escape, the artist made his way to Paris, and eventually met up with Marcel Duchamp, Tristan Tzara, and others in Marseilles. In October 1942, he finally arrived in the United States where, to aid the Free French, he lectured widely on his war experiences and wrote a bestseller entitled <i>They Shall Not Have Me.</i></p><p>H&#233;lion had originally encountered Cubism through Joaquin Torres-Garcia around 1927.  Afterwards, his art went through several transformations of style. For instance, his work from about 1929 to 1932 (the <i>Orthogonale</i> series) shows his appreciation for the planar severity of Theo van Doesburg and Russian Constructivism.  By 1935, flattened space in his work gave way to hard-edged, fully modeled machinelike forms, suspended in colored fields.  Increasingly, intuition became important to H&#233;lion, and a number of works, such as the <i>Untitled</i> watercolor of 1939, present organic forms with surrealist overtones. Before embarking for France in 1940, however, H&eacute;lion not only did outline drawings for several large  abstractions, he also planned numerous projects for figurative paintings as well. After the grueling experience of war, he concentrated on the figurative work. H&#233;lion returned to New York in 1944, but the following year he settled permanently in Paris, and his period of close contact with the New York art world came to an end.</p><p>From advice when Gallatin came to Paris on buying trips, to his relative success in exhibiting, H&#233;lion's influence on the New York scene took many forms. David Hare said that H&#233;lion represented "something &#133; lacking in this country. The artist as intellectual&#151;as accepted intellectual with a role in society. &#133; He was very secure in what the artist's role was. &#133; H&#233;lion represented what the avant-garde artist could be, perhaps should be, in relation to his society. &#133; He took his individuality extremely seriously. &#133; It gave the Americans &#133; a lot of confidence, to see somebody who has lived this way all his life and taking it as a matter of course &#133; ."(1)</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"2209","Artist Biography","<p>Since the early 1970s, potter Wayne Higby has explored the fusion of form and surface decoration through the depiction of panoramic Western landscapes on the surfaces of his earthenware bowls and covered boxes. Higby's scene-decorated vessels are not simply functional containers. For the artist, they are points of departure for imaginative journeys through the austere Colorado landscape of his childhood. As a youth, Higby loved to ride alone on horseback along the crests of the sandstone mesas to the east of Colorado Springs, and panoramic vistas of canyons, rivers, and vast rock formations constantly reappear on his vessels.</p>
<p>Since the enveloping scenery on his bowls is depicted according to the laws of perspective, and covers both the concave interior and convex exterior surfaces, the two-dimensional image completely penetrates the three-dimensional form. When lines and colors on both inside and outside suddenly combine into recognizable images, then surface and shape are instantly united, and the pot is magically transformed into an illusory scene that, given variegations in color, shade, and texture accidentally produced by raku firing, is suffused with a sense of natural light and atmosphere.</p>
<p><i>Temple's Gate Pass</i> (1993.54.6a-j) represented a return to the covered box format, first explored in the early 1970s. Fabricated after a sabbatical from teaching duties in 1986&ndash;87, it is composed of five diamond-shaped, lidded boxes, each of which is conceived and decorated as an independent form. Yet, when aligned corner to corner, the slabsided walls present a unified, accordianlike plane across which is represented a single, autonomous landscape vista&mdash;much like a scene depicted on one side of a folding Oriental screen. But Higby's multipart piece, is fully three dimensional, and as the spectator circles the piece, the depicted scene, while retaining its unity, constantly changes.</p>
<p><i>Temple's Gate Pass</i> represents the conjunction of two canyons in a panoramic vista of snowtopped mesas marked with turquoise lakes and rivers. It is not a specific locale, but an abstracted image of Western scenery. The austere geology of the Colorado mesas, characterized by sharply defined planes and edges, suggested the actual structure of the work. The micro-geometry of the boxes, composed of rhythmically alternating, handbuilt planes&mdash;some walls leaning inwards, others outwards&mdash;suggests the macroformations of the canyons themselves.</p>
<p>The landscape scene itself was based upon a series of panoramic drawings the artist made in 1988. Selecting one of the sketches, he first developed the physical structure of the linked boxes, and then, before and after firings, elaborated the design in three dimensions, ensuring its unity and continuous flow over multiple planes.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

"2232","Artist Biography","<p>Educated as a sociologist at the Universtiy of Chicago, Hine became involved with social welfare issues while pursuing studies at the Columbia University School of Social Philosophy.  As a teacher at the Ethical Culture School in New York City, he organized photographic excursions through New York's commercial and tenement areas in order to heighten his students' awareness of the world around them.  By 1904 Hine had begun to photograph immigrants, the poor, and the exploited as a means of studying and describing the social conditions faced by these people.</p> <p>He is best known, however, for his systematic and comprehensive documentation of child workers for the National Child Labor Committee.  Hine spoke about his work on extensive lecture tours, and his photographs were widely disseminated through newspapers, socially concerned publications, and posters.</p><p>Many of Hine's photographs of children, such as this image of a girl at the door of an orphanage, describe the relationship between an individual and an institution.  Here, Hine calls our attention to the austere space beyond the child, emphasizing the extent to which her home already seems like a factory.  The title given to the photograph&mdash;possibly when it was included in a portfolio of Hine's work organized by the New York Photo League in the late1940s&mdash;refers to the Dickensian comic-strip character "Little Orphan Annie," created in 1924, who was forced to labor for her keep at an orphanage.</p><p>Along with his photographs, Hine often sent the Child Labor Committee detailed reports of his conversations with children and their parents.  Providing revelant details about their lives, his comments supplemented the emotional content of the photographs.  This picture was part of a series documenting southern delta shrimp pickers and oyster shuckers.  Hine wrote: <i>Olga Schubert.  The little 5-year-old after a day's work helping her mother in the Biloxi Canning factory, began at about 5:00 A.M., was tired out and refused to be photographed.  The mother said, 'Oh, she's ugly.' Both she and other persons said picking shrimp was very hard on the fingers.</i></p><p>When used for publication, Hine's photographs were usually printed directly from a 5 x 7-inch  negative.  Occasionally he made enlargements for exhibtions or copy photographs that he cut up collaged with other images, and rephotographed.  Just barely visible in the upper right-hand corner of this copy is the tack that was used to hold the original in place.</p> <p>Hine was interested in photographing urban workers of all kinds.  Like painters George Luks, William Glackens, and Robert Henri , he found a modern nobility in working-class subjects.  The bold, simple composition of this portrait of a Washington handyman [<I>Handyman in Washington, D.C.,</I> SAAM, 1994.91.83] gives the picture its forcefulness and dignity.  The photograph was possibly made just after Hine completed work for Charles F. Weller's 1908 Washington slum study.</p> <p>Throughout his career Hine used a Graflex, a camera introduced in the first decade of the twentieth century, which made it easier for the photographer to see the picture just as the camera would record it.  Unlike earlier cameras that required the photographer to compose and focus before putting in the sensitive plate, the Graflex allowed Hine to frame his subject to the very edges of the plate and postpone decisions about focus and angle of view until the instant he clicked on the shutter.</p><p>Merry A.

"2279","Artist Biography","<P>Holmes led a remarkably varied life as an anthropologist, archaeologist, artist, draftsman, explorer, geologist, government official, and museum director. While studying under Theodor Kaufmann in 1871 in Washington, D.C., he met Fielding B. Meek of the Smithsonian Institution, who hired him to illustrate his paleontological reports. This was Holmes's first assignment requiring detailed drawings of fossils and other specimens. In 1872–79 he worked with geologist F. V. Hayden as a geologist-artist on Hayden's western surveys. Highlights of these years include travels to Yellowstone, discovery of the Mount of the Holy Cross and the Mesa Verde cliff dwellings in Colorado, and friendships with William H. Jackson and Thomas Moran. In 1880 Holmes worked with Major Clarence E. Dutton, preparing highly detailed topographical drawings of the Grand Canyon region for Dutton's <I>Tertiary History of the Grand Cañon District</I> (1882). Holmes later worked in the Field Museum of Natural History and taught anthropology at the University of Chicago.

His career began in 1872 with the government-sponsored Hayden Survey, on which he served as official geologist and artist, traveling through Wyoming and Colorado. During an association that lasted seven years, Hayden credited Holmes's "usual zeal and skill" with inspiring "much of the accuracy and value of the work." A subsequent expedition in 1880 through the Grand Canyon resulted in the remarkable drawings and watercolors Holmes made to illustrate Clarence Dutton's official report of the journey. In later years, Holmes's interests turned to archaeology and then back to art, when he was named director of the National Gallery of Art (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum) in 1920.

"2282","Artist Biography","<p>Carl Holty was born in Freiburg, where his father was attending medical school, but before he was a year old, the family moved to Milwaukee. As a teenager Holty took art classes, and by age sixteen was submitting cartoons to a local antiwar paper. In 1919, hoping to become a poster artist, Holty studied briefly at the school of the Art Institute of Chicago. Shortly thereafter, he left for New York, where he enrolled at Parsons School of Design and subsequently at the National Academy of Design. In 1923, he returned to Milwaukee to pursue a career as a portraitist. Three years later he left with his new bride for Munich, planning to study at the Royal Academy. Instead, he ran into his friend Vaclav Vytlacil, who convinced Holty to join Hans Hofmann's school. Holty's ideas were immediately transformed: "No one had ever talked to me about conceptual drawing, about knowing what I'm looking at from the point of view of my tactile knowledge as well as my visual knowledge. Hofmann did. And the world opened up just like that."(1)</p><p>In 1927, with his wife suffering from tuberculosis, the Holtys moved to Switzerland.  Although his study with Hofmann had been short-lived, the two kept in touch, and Holty began to assimilate Hofmann's teaching into his art. After the death of his wife in 1930, Holty moved to Paris, where Robert Delaunay sponsored his membership in <i>Abstraction-Cr&#233;ation</i> two years later. Holty's  curvilinear abstractions were published in the group's magazine in 1933. Nevertheless, his artistic aims weremore closely allied with Cubism than withNeo-plasticism, and he disengaged himself after a year. His canvases of the early 1930s, which reflect a close knowledge of Juan Gris's paintings and Picasso's Synthetic Cubism, were shown in several exhibitions in Paris to positive critical reviews. When Holty returned to New York in 1935, he soon found a New York dealer.</p><p>In New York, Holty became immersed in vanguard art circles and renewed his friendships with Hans Hofmann, Vaclav Vytlacil, and Stuart Davis, whom he had known in Paris. Vytlacil invited Holty to participate in the discussions that led to the formation of the American Abstract Artists. An articulate spokesman with extensive firsthand knowledge of European modernism, Holty was immediately drawn into the group, and subsequently became its chairman. He remained a member until 1944, when he felt the organization had fulfilled its purposes.</p><p>In his own art, Holty had begun to stray from the spatial and conceptual format of Cubism. Instead, biomorphic shapes that seem to move freely over the entire surface of the canvas indicate a fascination for the images, if not the ideas of Mir&oacute;. Increasingly, however, his earlier concern for structure reemerged to harness the still active rhythms of his compositions. In his abstractions, Holty did not seek to eliminate references to the natural world. He used titles&#151;<i>Of War,</i> <i>Circus Forms,</i> <i>Gridiron</i>&#151;as reference points or to set a mood. The form of a kneeling figure holding a ball can be discerned, for example, in <i>Gridiron.</i> During the 1930s, Holty began using tape to give crisp edges to form, and in <i>Gridiron,</i> which he reworked and overpainted before arriving at his final statement, the sharpness and clarity of this approach is especially apparent.</p><p>By the mid 1940s, Holty had been creating abstract paintings for many years, yet he continually searched for new ways to render form within the two-dimensional picture plane. He described one discovery in words that echo Hofmann: "In breaking up the shapes or forms, it is imperative not to attempt to rejoin them because thatleads to transformation only. By breaking them and keeping them broken, the forms, large and small, are simply densities in the rhythmic movement of color and shapes."(2)</p><p>By the 1960s, Holty had put aside his concern for tactile form within dimensional space. Contours disappeared, replaced by thinly washed, fluid areas of color swimming within subtly toned space.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"2283","Artist Biography","<p>Winslow Homer began his art career in 1854 or 1855 as an apprentice to J. H. Bufford, a lithographer in Boston. He left two years later to begin free-lance illustration. In 1859 Homer moved to New York, which remained his winter home until the 1880s, and studied for a brief time at the National Academy of Design and with Frederic Rondel. Between 1862 and 1865 he made illustrations of Civil War scenes for <i>Harper's Weekly</i> and turned seriously to landscape painting after the war's close. Homer was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1864 and in the following year a full academician. His first trip abroad came in 1866 and 1867, with ten months spent in France. During the summers of 1868 through 1881, Homer made several trips to the White Mountains, the Adirondacks, and Gloucester, Massachusetts. In 1881 he went to England, staying near Tynemouth, and returned to America late in 1882. The following summer, he settled in Prout's Neck on the coast of Maine, his home thenceforth. After 1884, Homer made hunting and fishing trips in the summers to the Adirondacks or Quebec with his brother and spent part of several winters in Nassau, Bermuda, or Florida.</p><p>No examination of the Barbizon mood in American painting can avoid recognition of Homer's singular contribution, despite the fact that his highly selective and independent course of study had only the most oblique connection with the art of the men from Fontainebleau. That Homer numbered among his few friends several admirers of Barbizon art; that he had ample opportunity to study Barbizon painting in Boston, New York, and Paris; that his favorite subjects included American workers on the farm or in seacoast villages, are all facts, but these facts do not adequately explain the peculiar appeal of Homer's special brand of realism. Nevertheless, during the years between his 1867 visit to Paris and his departure for Tynemouth in 1881, Homer executed several small studies of rural life in New England or Normandy that demonstrate a new sense of finesse in his handling of paint and diffused light, as well as an aura of circumspection usually missing in the artist's earlier work. His <i>Two Girls with Sunbonnets in Field</i> [Cooper-Hewitt Museum] from about 1877 is a remarkable achievement in this regard, a work comparable to the portraits of peasant youngsters by Millet that are so often enshrouded in the soft glow of twilight. The earlier <i>Girl with a Pitchfork,</i> [The Phillips Collection] which was probably painted from a Normandy sketch, is a prototype for the heroic fishwoman in many Homers executed much later at Tynemouth and Prout's Neck.</p><p>Peter Bermingham <I>American Art in the Barbizon Mood</I> (Washington, D.C.: National Collection of Fine Arts and Smithsonian Institution Press, 1975)</p>",""
"2283","Artist Biography","<p>No single artist represented as many different old New Englands as did Winslow Homer. An illustrator, watercolorist, marine and landscape painter, Homer's vision of his native region enjoyed great currency in his lifetime and influenced countless others, both before and after his death. His path to greatness, like so many other painters of the period, led directly out of a work-a-day middle-class background.</p><p>Homer's father owned a hardware store in Boston and his mother was an accomplished watercolorist. The younger Homer took a job with John Henry Bufford and, like James Wells Champney, the future artist seemed destined for a career as an illustrator. In 1859, however, Homer moved to New York City and began taking classes at the National Academy of Design. He came to popular attention during the Civil War as a sketch artist for <i>Harper's Weekly</i> and his oil paintings of wartime scenes secured his place as a major American talent. He was elected to the National Academy in 1866.</p><p>Homer traveled to Paris that year and upon his return focused his art on nostalgic scenes of rural life, including one-room school houses, children at play, country stores, and an old wooden mill. In 1881 and 1882, he lived in Cullercoats, an English fishing village on the North Sea coast. Homer relocated to Prout's Neck, Maine, and, for the remainder of his life, dedicated himself primarily to painting the rugged people and landscape of the Atlantic coastline.</p><p>William H.

In the 1920s he achieved recognition with his architectural paintings in which light is used dramatically to characterize his subjects. Whether depicting daylight scenes or nocturnal environments, his paintings have an introspective, contemplative aura that is enhanced by his frequent use of solitary figures set against blank walls. Mood was as important to Hopper as subject, as the statement he wrote for the catalogue of his 1933 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art makes clear: "My aim in painting has always been the most exact transcription possible of my most intimate impressions of nature."</p><p>Virginia M.

"2297","Artist Biography","<P>Hopper was born in Nyack, New York, to a businessman and a housewife who encouraged his early drawing talent. In deference to his parents' wishes, Hopper began to study for a career as a commercial artist at the New York School of Illustrating, but soon followed his own inclination toward fine art, transferring to the New York School of Art. He studied there with Robert Henri. Jo Nivison, whom Hopper would later marry, was also enrolled at the school. Early in his career Hopper was described as a "Puritan" by his friend the painter Guy Pène du Bois. He equated the term with Hopper's purist style but also with personal moral rigor and Americanness, a description Hopper enthusiastically accepted. In a review of his first retrospective in 1933, Hopper's work was said to fulfill the "requirements of what was meant by racial quality in American art. Puritan austerity and nothing in excess ... above all independence of thought and spirit." Undoubtedly his New England subjects contributed to this view. At Jo's suggestion he began painting watercolors, as well as oils, of Gloucester streets, Maine and Massachusetts lighthouses, and Cape Cod landscapes. Although the couple lived in New York City, they traveled around New England every summer, finally building a house and studio in Truro on Cape Cod.</P>

"2357","Artist Biography","<p>"In some works it is my intention to develop the kind of forms Nature might create if only heat and steel were available to her." &mdash; Richard Hunt quoted in Exhibition flier, <i>Richard Hunt</i>, (Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Art Gallery, 1966).</p><br /><p>For more than three decades Richard Hunt's status as the foremost African-American abstract sculptor and artist of public sculpture has remained unchallenged. Executed in welded and cast steel, aluminum, copper, and bronze, Hunt's abstract creations make frequent references to plant, human, and animal forms. Hunt prefers to be called a "Midwestern sculptor," and is one of the few well known African-American sculptors who still resides and works in his hometown.</p><p>Hunt was born on September 12, 1935, the younger of two children of Howard and Inez Henderson Hunt, a barber and a librarian respectively who lived on Chicago's predominantly black South Side. Both of Hunt's parents provided invaluable influences during his childhood. He acquired an early interest in politics from conversations he overheard while working in his father's barbershop. His mother instilled in him a love of reading and classical music, and took him to local black opera companies.</p><p>Hunt began drawing during his childhood, and enrolled in a summer program at the Junior School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he received his initial training in sculpture under Nelli Bar. In 1950 Hunt set up a studio in his bedroom, and began to model in clay. One of his earliest influences was the work of Julio Gonz&#225;lez in an exhibition, <i>Sculpture of the Twentieth Century,</i> held at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1953. Within two years Hunt had taught himself to master the welded-metal technique. Hunt's career at the Art Institute was outstanding. He was awarded the prestigious Logan, Palmer, and Campana prizes, and the James N. Raymond Foreign Traveling Fellowship in 1957, which permitted him to visit England, France, Spain, and Italy. Hunt was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1962, a Cassandra Foundation Fellow in 1970, and a Tamarind Fellow (awarded under the auspices of the Ford Foundation) in 1965. He has had numerous one-man and group exhibitions, has received a number of honorary degrees, and has served as Visiting Artist and Professor at many schools and universities. In 1969 Hunt became the first African-American sculptor to be honored with a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p><p>More than thirty examples of Hunt's sculptures are located in and around Chicago's libraries, community centers, universities, apartment houses, and office buildings. An equal number may be seen elsewhere in the Midwest, South, New York, and Washington, D.C. Hunt's early works of the 1950s were more figural than the later examples, and frequently reflected classical themes. During the 1960s and early 1970s Hunt used automobile junkyards as his quarries, and transformed cast-off automobile bumpers and fenders into elegant abstract welded sculptures.</p><p>The public sculptures of Richard Hunt undeniably bridge the gap between abstract art and the black experience in America, as is evident in such works as <i>Freedmen's Column</i> at Howard University and <i>I Have Been to the Mountain,</i> a memorial to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Memphis, Tennessee, where King was killed. Hunt's success and popularity as a sculptor of public pieces can be attributed to the universal appeal of his work and his remarkable ability to produce abstract works that are suggestive of themes and people of his immediate world.</p><p>Hunt is also an accomplished printmaker who prefers lithography. Many of his lithographs, such as <i>Untitled&#151;Bones</i> of 1964&#150;70, reflect the same elegant abstract forms seen in his metal sculptures. Some of  his lithographs were studies for his outdoor pieces and smaller sculptures.</p><p>Regenia A.

"2359","Artist Biography","<p>Hunt was the son of a Vermont congressman. He learned to draw at an early age, his first teacher being an Italian artist named Gambadella. After leaving Harvard College in his third year, Hunt was taken in 1844 by his widowed mother and her other four children to the south of France. After travel in the Middle East, they stopped in Rome where William did some drawing in the studio of American sculptor, Henry Kirke Brown.  In 1845, he entered the D&uuml;sseldorf Academy, but left the next year for Paris where he became a pupil of Thomas Couture from 1846 to 1852. The sight of Millet's <i>The Sower</i> at the Salon of 1851 in Paris inspired Hunt to spend most of the next two years with Millet at Barbizon. Hunt returned to the United States in 1854 and two years later moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where he painted and took a few pupils. In 1862, he settled permanently in Boston where the demand for his portraits grew as did the size and popularity of his classes. His last trip to Europe was made in 1867. The great Boston fire of 1872 destroyed Hunt's Summer Street studio and with it his collection of French paintings. He traveled to Mexico in 1875 and in the same year was commissioned to paint two murals for the new State Capital at Albany, New York. Shortly after their completion (and rapid demise due to faulty installation), Hunt drowned off the coast of New Hampshire.</p><p>The aversion of many Easterners to French art was regarded by Hunt to be an "unpardonable conceit" and to balance the record, he encouraged and supported a bevy of younger American artists as well as numerous patrons and collectors in the Boston area.  The lessons wrought from his training with Couture and Millet added to his ready wit and compelling presence gave Hunt more than enough equipment to articulate the aesthetic concerns of these men as well as those of several other French artists, especially from among the Barbizon group.  Hunt preached a gospel of directness, simplicity, harmony of effect, and a willingness to accept the relative beauty of even the most common subjects. Although one of New England's finest portraitists for over twenty years, Hunt made no secret of his difficulties in painting convincing landscapes, finding natural light and the constant changes it effects a particularly vexing problem. As a result, even his most charming landscapes (which are usually more indebeted to Corot or Daubigny than to Millet) give the appearance of a shorthand method grafted on to a studio design&mdash;usually one derived from from the many charcoal sketches, which Hunt was especially fond of executing.</p><p>Peter Bermingham <I>American Art in the Barbizon Mood</I> (Washington, D.C.: National Collection of Fine Arts and Smithsonian Institution Press, 1975)</p>",""

"2392","Artist Biography","<p>George Inness was born in New York City and grew up on a farm in Newark, New Jersey.

In 1844 he began exhibiting in New York, and later spent a month working with the landscape painter Regis Gignoux. During most of his life, he kept a studio in New York. Although he claimed that his concentration was limited by his "fearful nervous disease"&mdash;epilepsy&mdash;by 1860 he was considered "a man of unquestionable genius."  At the outbreak of the Civil War, lacking the good health to enlist, he offered bounties to those who did and painted uplifting allegorical landscapes. During the same years, Swedenborgianism would significantly influence his art and life. So would residence in New England. In 1860 he moved to Medfield, Massachusetts, where he spent four years painting pastoral scenes in the fresh air in an effort to restore his health. He returned during the summer of 1875, living at the Kearsarge House at the base of the White Mountains. He painted several landscapes of the mountain, but concentrated on atmospheric effects rather than the grandeur of the scenery, which most previous artists had emphasized. During two subsequent summers on Nantucket (1879 and 1883) Inness's style softened further, approaching the tonalist harmonies that prevailed in his late work.</p><p>William H. Truettner and Roger B.

"2424","Artist Biography","<p>Leaving his native New York in 1863, Jackson made his first trip west as a driver for a wagon train. As he had previously earned his living painting theatrical backdrops and political posters and working in a photographic gallery as a retoucher and colorist, it is not surprising that within a year he had opened a photography studio in Omaha, Nebraska. From 1870 to 1878 he was the official photographer for Ferdinand V. Hayden's U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories.</p><p>Jackson made his first photographs of the Yellowstone area in 1871, returning there many times in subsequent years. These images became extremely popular and also played an important part in convincing Congress to pass the bill in 1872 that established Yellowstone as the first national park. Working with fellow survey artists Sanford R. Gifford and Thomas Moran, Jackson developed a style of photography that was both descriptive and broadly pictorial. In turn, many artists drew upon Jackson's images as source material for their paintings.</p> <p>In 1879 he opened the Jackson Photographic Company in Denver to promote his pictures of western subjects. Jackson was often commissioned by the railroad companies to take photographs along new or already popular western routes, such as the Gunnison River in western Colorado. Competing with the scenery in many of these images are signs of commercial progress such as telegraph lines and railroad tracks. These published photographs stimulated interest in the region among business people and tourists.</p><p>In 1897 Jackson acquired part interest in the Detroit Publishing Company, later called the Detroit Photo Company, which published and distributed his photographs. It is often difficult to determine an exact date or attribution for these works because he employed numerous assistants and sometimes published the work of other photographers.</p><p>During the 1880s and 1890s Jackson's chief business was making large-scale panoramas commissioned by railroad companies throughout the United States. In many cases he printed his mammoth-plate negatives on collodion paper, which had a denser weave than albumen coated paper. Collodion not only hid the edge of the abutting negatives but also produced a glossy, non-yellowing image, undoubtedly more suitable for framing. At least two negatives were used to make this panorama of the Hudson River, which documents competing forms of transportation: the railroad and the steamboat.</p><p>Merry A.

<P><I>Man on Fire,</I> a larger than life-size sculpture, was inspired by Jose Clemente Orozco's 1938–39 dome painting in the Cabanas Orphanage in Guadalajara, Mexico. The work, which evokes the story of Cuauhtemoc, the legendary Aztec warrior who was tortured to death with fire by the Spaniards soon after the Conquest of Mexico in 1521, also reflects Luis Jiménez's keen awareness of Vietnamese monks who practiced self-immolation as a protest against the war in the 1960s.</P>

"2479","Artist Biography","<p>"As a <i>self-taught genius,</i> deriving from nature and industry his knowledge of the Art; and having experienced many insuperable obstacles in the pursuit of his studies, it is highly gratifying to him to make assurances of his ability to execute all commands with an effect, and in a style, which must give satisfaction." &mdash; Joshua Johnson quoted in Advertisement, "Portrait Painting," <i>Baltimore Intelligencer,</i> 19 Dec. 1798.</p><br /><p>Joshua Johnson, or Johnston, the earliest documented professional African-American painter, was active in Baltimore during the late eighteenth and first quarter of the nineteenth century. His background, however, remains a mystery. The families and descendants of those whose portraits he painted claim that Johnson was a former slave. Whether Johnson was a slave or not is open to question since his name appears in the City Directory of Baltimore from 1796 to 1824, when the directory did not list slaves. Johnson's identity as an African American has been questioned as well. In editions of the directory in which an asterisk designated a person of color, there is no asterisk by Johnson's name. Johnson may have been biracial and fair enough to elude identification as an African American by publishers of the directory. In the directory of 1817, however, Johnson's name appears among the "free householders of Color" listed separately in the publication.</p><p>There appears to be no question about Johnson's occupation. In all the directories he is listed as a "limner" or "portrait painter," and seems to have had at least eight different addresses in Baltimore and neighboring Fells Point. Johnson's birthplace is unknown. It might have been Baltimore, or more likely the French West Indies from which he may have come to Baltimore as an indentured servant who eventually earned his freedom. The names of Johnson's wife Sarah and their three children, George, John, and Sarah, are recorded in Catholic church records in Baltimore. Land records indicate that Johnson was a property owner in Montgomery, Frederick, and Anne Arundel counties in Maryland after 1824. The land records establish the fact that Johnson was apparently financially successful in his profession. </p><p>Johnson's identity as an artist was first established by J. Hall Pleasants, former secretary of the Maryland Historical Society, in an article published in 1939. When a retrospective exhibition of Johnson's paintings was held at the Peale Museum in Baltimore nine years later, twenty-five portraits were included. Since that time more than eighty works have been attributed to Johnson. None of Johnson's portraits is actually dated and only one bears his signature. The majority of Johnson's portraits have been assigned dates on the basis of the ages of the sitters, from about 1795 to 1825, and most depict affluent residents of Baltimore. All of the sitters in Johnson's portraits are white with the exception of two unidentified African-American males.</p><p>Many of the portraits, though not all, attributed to Johnson are drawn in the same stiff manner, the faces of the sitters in three-quarter view and their gazes straightforward. The backgrounds are usually plain, although some include a tiled floor and an open casement with landscape beyond a curtain. Favorite "stock objects" in Johnson's portraits were letters, books, gloves, parasols, riding crops, dogs, flowers, and fruit. Johnson frequently seated his subjects on upholstered Sheraton chairs or settees studded with brass tacks; as a result he has been called the "brass tack" artist.</p><p>In an advertisement placed by Johnson in the Baltimore <i>Intelligencer</i> of December 19, 1798, the artist described himself as a "self-taught" genius. Pleasants suggested that as a student of painting, or, as a slave, Johnson might have received training from some member of the Peale family who dominated Baltimore's art scene during the period of Johnson's activities. Johnson's name does not appear, however, in any of the Peale family's voluminous archives. Johnson's style is closely related to that of Charles Peale Polk (1767&ndash;1822, a nephew of the family patriarch Charles Willson Peale) in their mutual fondness for thinly painted surfaces, variety of accessories, and attention to costume details. It is unlikely that Johnson was entirely self-taught. If he did not receive his training from some member of the Peale family, he was at least familiar with their work.</p><p>Johnson's <i>Intelligencer</i> advertisement also referred to his "having experienced many insuperable obstacles in the pursuit of his studies." It seems reasonable to assume that Johnson was making a veiled reference to his race, and alluded to the fact that he had suffered racial and professional discrimination, yet had overcome such odds to some extent. The date and circumstances of Johnson's death are unknown.</p><p>Regenia A.

<P>Born in Boston on October 7, 1887, Sargent Johnson was the third of six children of Anderson and Lizzie Jackson Johnson. Anderson Johnson was of Swedish ancestry, and his wife was Cherokee and African American. All of the children were fair enough in complexion to be considered white, and several of Johnson's sisters preferred to live in white society. Sargent, however, was insistent upon identifying with his African-American heritage throughout his life.</P>
<P>The Johnson children were orphaned by the deaths of their father in 1897 and their mother in 1902. The children spent their early years in Washington, D.C., with an uncle, Sherman William Jackson, a high school principal whose wife was May Howard Jackson, a noted sculptress who specialized in portrait busts of African Americans. It was probably while young Sargent was living with his aunt that he developed his earliest interest in sculpture.</P>
<P>After living in the Jackson home in Washington, the young Johnson children were sent to live with their maternal grandparents in Alexandria, Virginia. From there they were sent to boarding schools. The boys went to the Sisters of Charity in Worcester, Massachusetts, and the girls to a Catholic school in Pennsylvania for Indian and African-American girls. While at the Sisters of Charity, Sargent was sent to a public school where he studied music, art, and mechanical drawing. He was later sent to Boston to music school, but soon became more interested in art. He enrolled in the Worcester Art School where he received his first formal art training. From Boston, Johnson went to Chicago where he lived with relatives for a brief time before deciding to move to the West Coast. Johnson arrived in the San Francisco area in 1915, during the time of the Panama Pacific International Exposition, which impressed him greatly.</P>
<P>The same year Johnson arrived in San Francisco, he met and married PearlLawson, an African American from Georgia who had moved to the Bay Area. The couple had one child, Pearl Adele, who was born in 1923. The couple separated in 1936 and shortly afterwards Mrs. Johnson was hospitalized at Stockton State Hospital, where she died in 1964.</P>
<P>Johnson worked at various jobs during his first years in San Francisco but also attended two art schools, the A. W. Best School of Art and the California School of Fine Arts. Johnson was enrolled at the latter school from 1919 to 1923 and from 1940 to 1942. He studied first under the well-known sculptor Ralph Stackpole for two years, and for a year with Beniamino Bufano. Johnson's student work at the California School of Fine Arts was awarded first prizes in 1921 and 1922.</P>
<P>In 1925 Johnson came to the attention of the Harmon Foundation. During the following year he began exhibiting in the foundation's exhibitions and was represented regularly from 1926 to 1935. Johnson won numerous awards in the Harmon Foundation shows, including the Robert C. Ogden prize in 1933 for the most outstanding work in the exhibition. In 1930 and 1931, the Harmon exhibition was shown at the Oakland Municipal Art Gallery and Johnson was represented in both shows, and was the only California artist to be included. Johnson's works of the 1920s consisted primarily of small, smoothly finished ceramic heads that were primarily of children and were greatly influenced by the style of Bufano.</P>
<P>The 1930s were the most productive decade in Johnson's career. His figure style retained the basic simplicity of his earlier works. He became more interested, however, in stylization of forms and experimented with a variety of mediums—terra cotta, wood, beaten copper, marble, terrazzo, porcelain, etchings, and gouache drawings. Johnson's earliest interest in African art became manifest around 1930 when he executed several copper masks based on African prototypes.</P>
<P>The W.P.A. Federal Art Project provided a number of opportunities for Johnson during the late 1930s in the Bay Area. Johnson's first large W.P.A. project was an organ screen carved of redwood in low relief for the California School of the Blind in Berkeley. The eighteen-by-twenty-four-foot panel was completed in 1937 and installed in the school's chapel. In 1939 he undertook another W.P.A. project, decorating the interior of the San Francisco Maritime Museum in Aquatic Park.</P>
<P>For the Golden Gate International Exposition held on the newly created Treasure Island in San Francisco in 1939, Johnson completed his largest figures. He designed two eight-foot-high cast stone figures, which were displayed around the fountain in the Court of Pacifica. Johnson's figures depict two Incas seated on llamas and are distinctly East Indian in inspiration. They are known as the "happy Incas playing the Piper of Pan," and are among Johnson's finest works. He also designed three figures symbolizing industry, home life, and agriculture for the Alameda-Contra Costa Building at the Exposition.</P>
<P>A final group of works from Johnson's mature period was an animal series depicting a camel, burro, grasshopper, duck, hippopotamus, and squirrel. Each of the figures was twenty-six-by-twenty-four inches and cast in gray and green terrazzo. These animals were part of a project for a child-care center playground in San Francisco, and comprise some of Johnson's most delightful works.</P>
<P>One of Johnson's favorite activities during the late 1950s and 1960s was collecting diorite rocks from the seashore near Big Sur, California. Diorite became one of Johnson's preferred materials in addition to cast stone and terra cotta. Johnson's last sculptures, completed in 1965 and 1966, were made of diorite and displayed a completely abstract style and simplicity.</P>
<P>Johnson moved a number of times in the final fifteen years of his life. Following an illness in 1965, Johnson finally settled in a small hotel room in downtown San Francisco. In October 1967 Johnson died there of a heart attack. During his long and distinguished career he never ceased to grow as an artist and to keep abreast of contemporary techniques. His works were influenced by Cubism as well as the art of West Africa, Latin America, and Mexico. Gifted with the remarkable ability to combine those influences with his own style, Johnson created sculpture that reflects his own vitality and originality.</P>

"2486","Artist Biography","<p>By almost any standard, William H. Johnson (1901&#8211;1970) can be considered a major American artist.  He produced hundreds of works in a virtuosic, eclectic career that spanned several decades as well as several continents. It was not until very recently, however, that his work began to receive the attention it deserves.</p><p>Born in South Carolina to a poor African-American family, Johnson moved to New York at age seventeen. Working a variety of jobs, he saved enough money to pay for an art education at the prestigious National Academy of Design.  His mastery of the academy's rigorous standards gained him both numerous awards and the respect of his teachers and fellow students.</p><p>Johnson spent the late 1920s in France, absorbing the lessons of modernism.  As a result, his work became more expressive and emotional. During this same period, he met and fell in love with Danish artist Holcha Krake, whom he married in 1930. The couple spent most of the '30s in Scandinavia, where Johnson's interest in primitivism and folk art began to have a noticeable impact on his work.</p><p>Returning with Holcha to the U.S. in 1938, Johnson immersed himself in the traditions of Afro-America, producing work characterized by its stunning, eloquent, folk art simplicity.  A Greenwich Village resident, he became a familiar, if somewhat aloof, figure on the New York art scene.  He was also a well-established part of the African-American artistic community at a time when most black artists were still riding the crest of the Harlem Renaissance.</p><p>Although Johnson enjoyed a certain degree of success as an artist in this country and abroad, financial security remained elusive. Following his wife's death in 1944, Johnson's physical and mental health declined dramatically.  In a tragic and drawn-out conclusion to a life of immense creativity, Johnson spent his last twenty-three years in a state hospital on Long Island.  By the time of his death in 1970, he had slipped into obscurity.  After his death, his entire life's work was almost disposed of to save storage fees, but it was rescued by friends at the last moment.  Over a thousand paintings by Johnson are now part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution's Smithsonian American Art Museum.</p><p>National Museum of American Art. <i>Homecoming: The Paintings of William H.

"2486","Artist Biography","<p>"And even if I have studied for many years and all over the world, . . . I have still been able to preserve the primitive in me. . . . My aim is to express in a natural way what I feel, what is in me, both rhythmically and spiritually, all that which in time has been saved up in my family of primitiveness and tradition, and which is now concentrated in me." &mdash; William H. Johnson quoted in Richard J. Powell, "In My Family of Primitiveness and Tradition: William H. Johnson's <i>Jesus and the Three Marys, "</i> <i>American Art</i> 5:4 (Fall 1991): 21.</p><br /><p>One of the most brilliant yet tragic careers of an early twentieth-century African-American artist was that of William H. Johnson. Originally from the Deep South, Johnson became a world traveler who absorbed the customs and cultures of New York, Europe, and North Africa. He completed hundreds of oils, watercolors, gouaches, pen-and-ink sketches, block prints, silk screens, and ceramics. Johnson's career also spanned a gamut of styles from the academic, through Impressionism, Cubism, Fauvism, and German Expressionism, to, finally, a "conscious naivet&#233;".</p><p>Johnson was born on March 18, 1901,in Florence, South Carolina. The eldest of five children, he dropped out of school at an early age to help support his family. As a child he frequently copied cartoons from local newspapers, an activity that developed his ability to tell a story in witty pictures. Johnson left Florence around 1918 and moved to New York where he enrolled in the National Academy of Design and worked notably with the painter Charles Hawthorne. In 1926 Hawthorne raised funds to send Johnson abroad to study.</p><p>During the winter of 1926 Johnson traveled to France where he studied and painted in Paris, Moret-sur-Loing, and Cagnes-sur-Mer. From 1927 to 1929 he also visited Corsica, Nice, Belgium, and Denmark. Johnson's earliest works in Paris and Corsica were impressionistic landscapes and cityscapes. He quickly developed a short-hand technique that included only the essentials of design. In late 1929 Johnson returned to New York with a number of his French-Corsican paintings. He exhibited some of these works in the Harmon Foundation show of 1930 and received the coveted gold medal.</p><p>Following this success, Johnson returned to Europe and married a Danish textile artist, Holcha Krake, whom he had met in southern France. The newlywed Johnsons traveled across France and Belgium to Denmark where they settled in the small fishing village of Kerteminde, near his wife's home. The people of Kerteminde welcomed Johnson warmly and were fascinated by his paintings of gardens, old houses, and scenes of marine life.</p><p>In 1933 the Johnsons spent several months in North Africa where they delighted in the colorful Arabian bazaars and mosques, painted numerous portraits of the residents, worked in ceramics, and were taught age-old secrets of glazing and firing. The couple then traveled across Norway by bicycle. Johnson's paintings of that period capture the fresh atmosphere of spring with blossoming trees, the clear water of the deep fjords, and the blues of distant snow-capped mountains. Sailing next from Aalesund, Sweden, north to Troms&ouml;, the two artists continued to paint and immerse themselves in the beauties of nature. They lived in Svolv&aelig;r in the Lofoten Islands where Johnson painted and Holcha painted and wove her copy of the Baldishol Tapestry.</p><p>The threat of World War II prompted Johnson to return to the United States in 1938. In a pronounced and unexpected transition in his style, Johnson became interested in religious paintings and his subjects were almost exclusively African American. Using a palette of only four or five colors and painting frequently on burlap or plywood, Johnson developed a flat, consciously naive style. During the early 1940s, war activities, the Red Cross, and other related events interested Johnson and provided grist for his widely exhibited narrative paintings.</p><p>In January 1944 Johnson's wife Holcha died of cancer, an event that nearly shattered both his life and career. In June 1944 Johnson traveled to Florence, South Carolina, to visit his mother for the first time in fourteen years. There he painted a number of portraits of family and friends, as well as a series of paintings portraying seated women staring directly at the observer.</p><p>In 1945 Johnson began his final paintings&#151;social, historical, andpolitical panels including a series of narrative themes built around single subjects such as Booker T. Washington and John Brown. These paintings were exhibited only once in the United States. Late in 1946, still despondent over his wife's death, Johnson packed all of his art and returned to Denmark where he hoped to find peace among his wife's family in the country that he had grown to love. He exhibited his historical and political paintings in Copenhagen in March 1947, which was the last exhibition of his works held during his lifetime. There is quite a bit of Matisse's worship of unrestricted colors in his pictures," wrote a Danish critic of Johnson's last show, "But where Matisse is an aesthetician, Johnson goes further and shows us the working people of the southern states, the Negroes and their leaders, and their entirely strangely colorful world. . . ."</p><p>Johnson, whose peculiar behavior had been noticed by close friends, became mentally ill shortly after his last show in Denmark. He was cared for temporarily in Denmark and later sent back to New York where he was hospitalized. On April 13, 1970, Johnson died at Central Islip State Hospital on Long Island, where he had spent the last twenty-three years of his life in obscurity, unable to produce any art. Today Johnson is considered one of the most important African-American artists of his generation.</p><p>Regenia A.

Wood chisels proved more practical when he began to carve life-size busts of people and heads of animals from hardwood logs. Table-top freestanding figures, singly or in groups, began to appear in the mid 1970s.

Back in New York in 1952, Kahn and several other Hofmann students organized the Hansa Gallery, a cooperative named for their teacher. Avoiding a specific aesthetic program, the Hansa artists, who numbered ten to fifteen members at a time, tended toward either painterly realism with expressionist overtones (Kahn and Alan Kaprow) or found-object constructivism (Richard Stankiewicz and John Chamberlain). In the 1960s the bright colors and energetic brushwork characteristic of Kahn's Hansa years gave way to muted tones, simplified compositions, and quiet paint handling. Kahn sees his landscapes as meditations on the world in which color relates light with subject, and in which horizons, nature's dividing lines, are seamless fusions between sky and land.

"2529","Artist Biography","<P>Jacob Kainen died in March [2001] at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, at the age of ninety-one. During our twenty-five years of friendship, I came to view his life and his art as inextricably intertwined. Kainen's extraordinary intelligence and his deeply felt passions are likewise inseparable. His complex vision is vividly apparent in the many hundreds of paintings on canvas and paper he produced and in his important body of drawings and prints that span more than seventy years.</P>
<P>Kainen devoted most of his time over several decades to scholarship, curatorial work, and the encouragment of younger artists that Avis Berman describes in her accompanying tribute. During those years, he confined his creative efforts to nights and weekends. The vast number of paintings and works on paper that he completed under these circumstances is nothing less than astonishing. It is a legacy that confirms the notion that a painter finds time to paint regardless of life's demands.</P>
<P>In addition to art, Kainen was keenly interested in politics, music, literature (especially poetry), and philosophy. His immense curiosity enlivened his art, as it did his writings, lectures, and the informal conversations we had in his studio on a regular basis over two decades. Kainen began his life as an artist in New York during the 1930s. In his early paintings, his varied intellectual concerns were somewhat overt. As a response to the economic hardship and unrest of the period, his pictures embraced political and social concerns. Many of his canvases depict disasters: <I>Tenement Fire</I> and <I>Disaster at Sea</I> (both 1934), <I>Flood</I> (1935), and <I>Invasion</I> (1936). Others record moments in daily life: <I>Cafeteria</I> (1935), <I>Hot Dog Cart</I> and <I>Oil Cloth Vendor I</I> (both 1937) and <I>Barber Shop</I> (1939). In Kainen's later abstract work, his social and philosophical concerns were less obvious.</P>
<P>Kainen's self-education in museums and libraries, where he studied the work of Rembrandt, Diego Velázquez, John Constable, and Paul Cézanne, among others, had a more profound influence on his art than his early classes at the Art Students League and Pratt Institute. From the beginning, his paintings were both dramatic and romantic, revealing not only his knowledge of these earlier masters, but also a keen awareness of twentieth-century expressionism, especially in Europe but also in America. He was familiar with the art of Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Edvard Munch, as well as the work of George Bellows and John Sloan.</P>
<P>Interlocking shapes, layered forms, and strong gestures mark his early paintings, and suggest aspects of the abstract work that followed. The color world that Kainen created in the 1930s is prescient of the extraordinary subtlety that became a hallmark of his mature abstractions. The muted tones of his early canvases contrast greatly with the brilliant colors of his later ones. In both early and late work, however, he juxtaposed hues that could never be found on any paint manufacturer's color chart; instead, he lovingly mixed paint from various tubes to create new colors that he then applied in layers. Thus he created a rich surface pulsation that pervades not only his canvases and paintings on paper but also his late color woodcuts.</P>
<P>In New York Kainen forged close friendships with some of the city's most forward-looking artists, including John Graham, Arshile Gorky, and Stuart Davis, all of whom were examining abstraction. In 1942 he left New York to assume a curatorial position at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and explored his new home through his art. Kainen's interest in abstraction shines through such Washington street scenes as <I>Street Corner with Red Door</I> (1947) and <I>Clock Tower</I> (1948). By 1949, abstraction, frequently peppered with referential elements such as figures and trees, became ascendant in Kainen's approach. The titles of works such as <I>Magician</I> (1951) suggest figurative motifs, whereas titles like <I>The Coming of Surprise</I> (1951) hint at metaphysical, nonfigural themes.</P>
<P>This focus on abstraction ended around 1957, when his imagination was again fired by representation. The essential facture of his work, however, had undergone radical changes during his exploration of abstraction; Kainen's new approach to representation incorporated these painterly effects. He enhanced color shapes by overpainting them, and they took on a life apart from and of equal importance to their representational function. The figure—both nude and clothed—was the primary subject of this phase of Kainen's work. The paintings of Kirchner and Henri Matisse may have served as inspiration for Kainen's <I>Crimson Nude</I> (1961) in its subject matter and use of dynamic color and richly gestural paint handling. Portraits of artist friends in his Washington circle occupied him as well during these years. In <I>Gene Davis</I> (1961) vertical stripes, which marked Davis's signature style, envelop the artist. <I>The Shannons</I> (1964) shows painter Joseph Shannon with his arm wrapped around his wife, who carries their small child in her folded arms.</P>
<P>Kainen returned to a lyrical, generally high-keyed abstraction by the close of the 1960s. His firm commitment to this direction in his art corresponded with his marriage to Ruth Cole in 1969 and his retirement from his curatorial position a year later. Ruth Kainen's dedication to him and his work would have been reason enough for the buoyant spirits that sparked Kainen's work for the rest of his life. For a brief time, his forms became fairly hard-edged, his fields of color relatively unmodulated. But by 1972, the pulsation of form and color that had previously been central to his art—both figurative and abstract—regained dominance, never again to be abandoned.</P>
<P>Jacob Kainen died while preparing to go to his studio. He had continued to examine the painterly process in all of its aspects—color, gesture, and form—until the very end of his life. He began <I>Broken Arc,</I> for example, when he was eighty-five and completed it three years later. Its shimmering color and gracefully fluid shapes and its tension between geometry and nature summarize many of Kainen's preoccupations throughout his career. Suggestive of youthful energy, its true accomplishment is in fusing extemporaneity with the experience and wisdom acquired over a long, immensely productive life.</P>

"2538","Artist Biography","<p>Gerome Kamrowski entered the St.Paul, Minnesota, School of Art in 1932. There he studied with Cameron Booth and Leroy Turner, both former Hans Hofmann students who were also associated with the <i>Abstraction-Cr&#233;ation</i> group in Paris. It was Cameron Booth or Turner who introduced Kamrowski to a "kind of expressionist cubism."(1) By 1935, while employed by the WPA, Kamrowski was working in a Synthetic Cubist style, as evidenced by his mural for Northrup Auditorium at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>In 1937, Kamrowski left for Chicago to study under Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Alexander Archipenko at the New Bauhaus. There he was exposed to the role of nature in art and the "geometric basis of natural form."(2) Intrigued by Moholy's wit, Kamrowski commended him for being more than simply a "formalist-constructivist."(3) The following year, Kamrowski received a Guggenheim fellowship to attend Hans Hofmann's summer school in Provincetown, Massachusetts. From there, he went to New York, where he met William Baziotes, who was experimenting with Surrealism. Their growing friendship reinforced a fascination with Surrealism that had begun while Kamrowski was still a student in Minnesota. Before coming to New York, Kamrowski had read the Surrealist publication, <i>Minotaure,</i> and he had seen the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition, <i>Fantastic Art, Dada and Surrealism,</i> when it toured to Minneapolis. With Baziotes he shared an interest in Surrealist automatic writing, and both explored its potential in theirpaintings.(4) Kamrowski was especially attracted by Surrealism's appeal to intuition rather than the intellect; Surrealists, he said, offered "a certain aspect of humanism &#133;  that brought out a more comprehensive scheme than just the narrow, professional attitude towards form which Hofmann would try to present."(5)</p><p>Kamrowski himself was interested in the energy generated by the act of painting. He believed his work to be "essentially process, instead of representing a high, spiritual state which nonobjective art aspires to." As apparent in <i>Spectral Images</i> of 1944, he sought a process that "binds all things together. . . a kind of cosmic rhythm," which Cubism seemed to restrict.(6) He used Surrealist motifs and forms as liberating elements in his painting, but at the same time he emphasized their abstract qualities.</p><p>In 1942, Surrealist artist Matta (Echaurren) attempted to form a group of artists to investigate new applications for Surrealist methods. He invited Kamrowski, along with William Baziotes, Jackson Pollock, Peter Busa, and Robert Motherwell to join. Like Kamrowski, the others were more interested in process than in subject matter&mdash;the foundation of Matta's art&mdash;and the group soon dissolved.</p><p>Given the anti-Surrealist stance of the American Abstract Artists, Kamrowski seemed an unlikely member. Nevertheless, he joined the group in 1937 while working at the Chicago Bauhaus, and continued his membership for two years after moving to New York. In the group's exhibitions, he showed canvases inspired by Cubist principles, a style he continued to employ even after turning to Surrealism. Hilla Rebay, at the Museum of Non-objective Painting, provided support for Kamrowski based on these works. Realizing that Rebay would withdraw Kamrowski's much-needed financial assistance if she knew of his Surrealist inclinations, he continued to makeCubist paintings, and exhibited the Surrealist works anonymously. These were the paintings that subsequently brought him acclaim.(7) By 1950, his success with Surrealism prompted Andr&eacute; Breton to remark: "Of all the young painters whose evolution I have been able to follow in New York during the last years of the war, Gerome Kamrowski is the one who has impressed me far the most by reason of the "quality" and sustained character of his research.

"2588","Artist Biography","<p>Considered a pioneer of hard-edge painting, Ellsworth Kelly is best known for his crisp nonrepresentational works, intensely colored and radically simplified. His early training in the applied art program at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, was interrupted by his induction into the army in 1943. Art Historian E. C. Goossen has speculated that Kelly's assignment to a camouflage battalion provided him with invaluable lessons about the interaction of form and shadow in space, which were applied later in his collages, paintings, and sculpture.</p><p> After studying for two years at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Kelly went to Paris in 1948 to attend the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts until 1950. In France he encountered the works of Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Jean Arp, and Piet Mondrian. His figurative work subsequently gave way to increasingly abstract paintings in which curvilinear and rectilinear forms suggest fragments of visual phenomena such as architectural elements and shadows.</p><p> In 1950 he began to explore the random selection of color and form by using collages, composed of torn details of his drawings, as the basis for his paintings. While in France Kelly also produced grid paintings built on modular and serial systems. By 1952 these concerns were expressed in large multipanel paintings in which each panel was a module of color. Kelly's concern with color as form was thus established.</p><p>After returning to the United States in 1954, Kelly worked with large single biomorphic shapes in black and white.

By the early 1940s he was experimenting with Surrealism, creating macabre canvases depicting enormous insects and abstract forms resembling flayed human musculature.

Kent admired the values of those who lived in the wilder parts of New England, believing their way of life exemplified his ideas of Christian socialism in which poverty and hard work were high goals.

Rheumatic heart condition discovered. 1962, suffered heart attack in February; unable to paint. Died 13 May 1962, New York.</p><p>From 1935 to 1938, at a time when many American painters were employed by the Works Progress Administration, Kline was studying in London. Nevertheless, the Depression-era themes of city and labor that were important to many WPA artists were adopted by Kline as well when he returned to America and settled in New York City. In <i>Palmerton, Pa.</i> (1941), the artist depicted a rural equivalent of urban bleakness. Palmerton, near Kline's home town of Wilkes-Barre, is portrayed as a dingy, unprosperous hill town. The palette seems tinged with soot, buildings cluster insubstantially against the hillside, and even the train is deprived of a sense of power or speed. Although it is stretching it to claim to perceive the roots of his mature Abstract Expressionist work in this small painting, Kline does fill the canvas from bottom to top with hills, and spatial recession is sacrificed to an overall surface of broadly painted forms. The painting was exhibited in 1943 at the annual exhibition of the National Academy of Design and won the $300 S.J. Wallace Truman Prize.<p><p>Kline's large, gestural, black-and-white canvases established his reputation in 1951 and became synonymous with his name in the public mind. In addition to <i>Merce C,</i> the [Smithsonian American Art] museum owns another major black-and-white Kline of 1961, an untitled work. Using acrylic paints, he produced a complex surface in which white is admixed with gray tones. As always, Kline painted the white as much as the black; it is not black on white but a dynamic dialogue between the two. The racing horizontals across the bottom supply a sure sense of gravity, but also refuse to respect the lateral boundaries of the canvas. Their great trajectory pushes the edge outward, and the slightly tilted verticals, like the stack of an ocean liner, add to the sense of speed.</p><p>Although he is often thought of as only working in black and white, in fact Kline used color throughout his career. While black-and-white paintings dominated the early fifties, about 1956 color began to reassert itself in his work. Two paintings of modest size in the [Smithsonian American Art] museum, both from the end of the decade, represent this development. <i>Blueberry Eyes</i> (1959&ndash;60) reverberates with the deep, saturated blue of the fruit. Simultaneously dynamic and structural like the black-and-white paintings, it differs from them in that the warm color suggests spatial or atmospheric depth. An untitled oil-on-paper painting (ca. 1959), despite its small size (24 X 18 1/4 in.), is more complex and agitated in drawing and structure, and more varied and intense in color. Black is used as well for the skeletal shape brushed brashly over the red, green, and yellow field. Both of these late color paintings embody a vein of emotionalism that Kline mined toward the end of his life. Cut short by his death at fifty-one, Kline's developing art is full of confidence, as evidenced by this imposing late work. Like the large, late black-and-whites in the NMAA, Kline's color works suggest enormous potential that was destined to remain unrealized.</p><p>William Kloss <i>Treasures from the National Museum of American Art</i> (Washington, D.C. and London: National Museum of American Art with the Smithsonian Institution Press, 1985)</p>",""

"2668","Artist Biography","<p>Karl Knaths, who lived in Provincetown, Massachusetts, from 1919 until his death in 1971, was one of the first Americans whose work found its way into Albert Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art. By virtue of his residence away from New York, Knaths was never an active member of the American Abstract Artists. Nevertheless, his affiliation brought distinction to the group. Knaths was older than many of the group's members, and exhibited in New York to generally positive reviews from about 1930 on (although he once remarked that except for Duncan Phillips's annual purchase, he did not sell a single painting for twenty-three years).(1) Recognized as an important modernist, he had the valuable support of Duncan Phillips. Over the years Phillips bought many of Knath's paintings and frequently invited him to lecture at the Phillips Collection in Washington. In October 1945, Knaths exhibited in a group show at the Paul Rosenberg Gallery. The following January, he had the first of twenty-two solo exhibitions&#151;almost one each year&mdash;until his death twenty-five years later.</p><p>Originally from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in 1912 Knaths entered the school of the Art Institute of Chicago where he remained for five years. From there he went to New York, and later settled in Provincetown. In 1922, three years after his move to Cape Cod, he married Helen Weinrich, a pianist, whose sister Agnes was a Paris-trained abstract painter, and built the house that would be his home for the remainder of his life. During the winters, the Knaths and Weinrich usually spent a month in New York; but Europe, which attracted so many of Knaths, colleagues, failed to lure him from his beloved Provincetown.</p><p>Yet, in his lecture notes, and in a manuscript for an unpublished book entitled <i>Ornament and Glory,</i> Knaths, thorough understanding of modernist tenets as well as the principles of Renaissance and subsequent European art is apparent.(2) His papers contain typescripts of Hans Hofmann's lectures and writings by Mondrian, Malevich, Kandinsky, and other important theorists of modernism. Yet of all the artists whose work he knew well, the strongest parallels to Knaths, work come with C&eacute;anne's late paintings. Both artists blended an intuitional understanding of structure with motifs drawn from observed nature. For his subject matter, Knaths drew repeatedly from his Provincetown surroundings: deer in landscape settings, clamdiggers returning from work, fishing shacks, boats in the harbor, still lifes of duck decoys and fishing paraphernalia. But Knaths also found inspiration in American folklore and literature, and did paintings of Johnny Appleseed, Paul Bunyan, and Herman Melville's Ahab.</p><p>Knaths was one of the most theoretically inclined painters of his generation. He agreed with Kandinsky that "there are definite, measurable correspondences between sound in music and color and space in painting: specifically, between musical intervals and color intervals and spatial proportions."(3) Knaths worked out intricate charts for color and musical ratios,which he used to determine directional lines and proportions in his paintings. Like Hofmann, he believed that "whatever is to be realized by the painting should arise through the use of pictorial elements in a thematic way. The surface being the prime element, it is possible to manipulate full spaciousness within its flat terms &#133;"(4)</p><p>At some point, Knaths discovered Wilhelm Ostwald's color system. Based on color and not on light, the Ostwald system was devised as a way of ordering color, and was quite popular among American artists of the time. Knaths not only used this system, he harnessed it to a complex set of mathematical and geometrical relations&mdash;akin to musical proportions&mdash;so that the theoretical foundations of his art were both complex and highly worked out.</p><p>In his paintings, whether sketchy, experimental works like the <i>Untitled</i> gouache, circa 1939&ndash;40, or in more highly ordered canvases, Knaths remained true to the artistic principles he began to develop early in his life.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"2760","Artist Biography","<P>John LaFarge was born in New York City, the son of prosperous French emigres, his father having been a refugee from the ill-fated Napoleonic expedition to San Domingo. LaFarge began drawing at an early age, had intermittent instruction, and graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount St. Mary's College in Maryland. In 1856 he went to Europe, worked briefly under the painter Thomas Couture in Paris, and traveled in northern Europe. Returning to the United States, he went to Newport in order to study with William Morris Hunt. There he met William and Henry James (William James was then also a student of Hunt's).</P>
<P>LaFarge was one of the first American artists to import and be influenced by Japanese color prints (1863). He made a trip to Japan with Henry Adams in 1886, later publishing <I>An Artist's Letters from Japan</I> (1897).</P>
<P>In 1876 LaFarge completed a whole complex of mural decorations for Richardson's distinguished Trinity Church in Copley Square, Boston; it was his first large-scale commission. H. H. Richardson won the architectural competition for the New Trinity; he and LaFarge had been friends for some time. LaFarge wrote of Trinity, "I was able to propose to Richardson to change entirely the character of his building. … I brought him photographs of the Spanish Romanesque churches, Avila and so forth. … It was thus that I came to decorate Trinity Church, Boston, which was being built by my friend Richardson, who believed in me without having much proof of what I could do in that way."</P>
<P>LaFarge worked out a technique for creating opalescent glass, and had many commissions from churches and private patrons for stained glass windows. Some of the important commissions were for windows at Trinity Church, Boston; Memorial Hall at Harvard; the Church of the Incarnation and the Paulist Church, New York City. But alongside these commissions, LaFarge continued to paint and accept mural commissions. Perhaps the best known of the latter is the great apse mural of the Ascension of Christ in the Church of the Ascension in New York City, completed in 1887.</P>
<P>By birth, upbringing and style of life, John LaFarge was a cosmopolite. The evidence of his own contemporaries is that he exercised a considerable personal magnetism.

"2811","Artist Biography","<p>Ibram Lassaw came from Egypt to New York as a child. He studied at the Clay Club from 1926 to 1930, and at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York in 1930 and 1931. Yet he was haunted by the work of Jacques Villon, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and Wassily Kandinsky that he saw in an exhibition of Katherine Dreier's famed Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Anonyme collection at the Brooklyn Museum in the winter of 1926-27. His turn to abstraction in the early 1930s began with Constructivist drawings. However, it was the English language version of Moholy-Nagy's <i>The New Vision,</i> and several articles on "Universal Architecture" by Buckminster Fuller, that gave Lassaw a framework for understanding the new art.(1) To Lassaw, Moholy-Nagy's book was important less for its philosophical stance than for its illustrations of the tactile experiments conducted at the Bauhaus that suggested new materials and new sculptural processes.(2) Fuller "opened up. . . new perspectives" for Lassaw because he discussed the similarities between architectural design and such natural systems as trees and the human body.(3)</p><p>Lassaw's early abstract sculptures, which were modeled in clay and then cast in plaster, explored biomorphic shape and open form. Since that time, whether in constructions of metal and Plexiglas or in his brazed and welded pieces, the interpenetration of form in space has remained one of his abiding concerns. During the mid 1930s, Lassaw worked briefly for the Public Works of Art Project cleaning sculptural monuments around New York City. He subsequently joined the WPA as a teacher and sculptor until he was drafted into the army in 1942.</p><p>Much of Lassaw's experimentation during the 1930s focused on process&mdash;finding appropriate methods to express dual respect for space and "truth to materials." He gave up plaster work as too fragile for open-form sculpture. He briefly tried liquid latex, which for a variety of reasons, including its smell, was unsatisfactory. With Gertrude Greene, he bought a forge and tried hammering steel, but found the results excessively two-dimensional.</p><p>About 1937 he began constructing sculpture. From an old refrigerator motor he improvised brazing tools and began to build frameworks with iron rods. To these structures, which he painted, he connected carved white wooden shapes. In the 1938 annual exhibition of the American Abstract Artists, he showed a series of shadow boxes, shallow wooden containers holding plaster-coated wire, mesh, and free-form organic shapes that were lighted with electric bulbs. In these works, Lassaw sought a formal balance between geometric and organic form. But when he showed a steel and plastic sculpture entitled <i>Intersecting Rectangles</i> in the 1941 American Abstract Artists exhibition, Piet Mondrian encouraged him to proceed along Neo-plastic lines. During the next several years, Lassaw experimented with geometric, Constructivist spatial configurations, often combining steel with plastic and Lucite. Yet, while each approach offered intriguing possibilities, none enabled Lassaw to work freely and intuitively. A breakthrough came for him in 1950. In a sculpture entitled <i>Milky Way</i>, he dripped melted plastic over a wire armature. Although neither aesthetically pleasing nor durable, <i>Milky Way</i> nonetheless set the stage for Lassaw's future direction.</p><p>During World War II, Lassaw had learned to weld, and in 1951, when he sold his first piece of sculpture, he bought oxyacetylene welding equipment. Following the direction of <i>Milky Way,</i> he welded rods into open-form architectonic structures, then encrusted the surfaces with droplets of metal. By using different alloys within the same piece, Lassaw achieved remarkable variations in color, which he also enhanced through chemical treatment. With sculpture such as <i>The Hyades</i> (1951), Lassaw found methods and materials that integrated biomorphic and geometric form while satisfying his need to work freely and intuitively.</p><p>Lassaw once remarked that all artists have ancestors. In his own work, he claimed affinities with the sculpture of Julio Gonzalez, Naum Gabo, Antoine Pevsner, Vladimir Tatlin, Jacques Lipchitz, Joan Mir&#243;, and others. Unlike many of his fellow members of the American Abstract Artists who deplored Surrealism as formally backward, Lassaw borrowed freely from Mir&oacute;, especially during the mid 1930s. During this time, he also assigned neutral titles to his work&#151;<i>Composition with Light,</i> for example, or <i>Three Biomorphic Forms.</i> In 1944, he first used the names of astronomical phenomena, Zen precepts, and Jungian terms, suggesting evocative, often cosmic, allusions.</p><p>Lassaw was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists and continues to show with the group. He was also a founding member of the Club. Despite his involvement with these and other groups, and his frequent inclusion in group shows, it was not until Samuel Kootz had seen his work at the Whitney that Lassaw had his first solo exhibition (1951). In the following years, Lassaw emerged as one of the most provocative and significant artists of the century. He has exhibited frequently, and his sculpture has received wide-ranging, positive critical attention.</p><br /><br /><p>1. Lassaw had begun reading extensively, trying to understand what he had seen.  Clive Bell's and Roger Fry's books, other volumes of art history and aesthetics, and works in science, astronomy, cosmology, and human anatomy all contributed to his growing understanding of the new art forms. See Ibram Lassaw, "Perspectives and Reflections of a Sculptor: A Memoir," <i>Leonardo</i> 1, no. 4 (October 1968): 351&ndash;61. This article, in which Lassaw describes his artistic evolution, fascination with materials, and the myriad philosophical and artistic sources that fueled his ideas, is one of the few times Lassaw discussed his work in print.</p><p>2.

By 1913, Lazzell had returned to West Virginia and opened a school. In 1915 she attended the Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown, Massachusetts, which had become a meeting place for artists returning from Europe to escape the chaos of World War I. In 1916 Lazzell and several other artists exhibited their work in color woodblock at the studio of E. Ambrose Webster. With the success of this show, the Provincetown Printers Group became the first color-woodblock society to be established. During a trip to Europe in 1923, Lazzell studied cubism with Fernand Leger and also received instruction from Andre Lhote and Albert Gleizes. She returned to America in 1924, and from 1937 to 1938 studied with the abstract artist Hans Hofmann.</P>

"2842","Artist Biography","<p>Throughout her long career Blanche Lazzell remained open to new experiences and ideas. Her early work in Paris between 1912 and 1914 had introduced her to the more radical European movements. By 1925, following two years of study with Albert Leon Gleizes, Andre Lhote, and Fernand Leger in Paris, she had become fully committed to a decorative, geometric cubism. Cubism, as Lazzell defined it, "the organization of flat planes of color, with an interplay of space, instead of perspective," was admirably suited to her woodcuts and to the angular patterns of the Provincetown houses, rooftops, and wharves that dominated much of her work. Lazzell was a passionate gardener, and flower images occurred repeatedly in her work. Even these images, although based on direct observation, were transformed into rhythmic interplays of abstracted shapes. Her mastery of the complexities of the cubist aesthetic is perhaps best represented in a remarkable group of block prints made in 1925, which are among the earliest nonrepresentational prints created in the United States.</p><p>For more than forty years Blanche Lazzell passed almost every summer, and many winters as well, in Provincetown. There she entertained visitors in her quaint wharf studio, displaying her work and demonstrating the techniques of wood-block cutting and printing. Her "Color Wood Block Printing," a course "of five or more private lessons $5 per lesson," attracted numerous students, many of whom continued to work in the medium throughout their careers. George Ault, Mary Mullineux, Hope Voorhees Pfeiffer, Elizabeth Shuff Taylor, and Grace Martin Taylor are only a few of the artists who benefited from her tutelage and example.</p><p>Between 1916 and 1956 Lazzell created more than 138 blocks and countless impressions through a process that seems to have held a continual fascination for her. Her block prints were technically distinguished by fine cutting and meticulous, sensitive printing. The cutting was made almost exclusively by knife, following a design drawn directly on the block. In printing, a sheet of paper, usually oriental, was affixed to the top edge of the block and folded back, away from the cut image. As each segment was colored, the paper was returned to the block and printed with pressure from the bowl of a spoon. If the pressure were increased, the paper was forced more deeply into the cut grooves, producing an embossed white line. Watercolors were used for printing (French watercolors were preferred), and Chinese white was occasionally added for opaque pastel tones.</p><p>Lazzell was never concerned about producing exact duplicates of her prints or even consistent editions of them. Rather, as she wrote to Katharine McCormick, "I use perfect freedom as to color and values. &#133; I trust to my inspiration at the time I do the print." She continued, "I give myself one week to the making of one print. It is not a paying business as far as price is concerned. I do them because I like to."</p><p>Janet Altic Flint <i>Provincetown Printers: A Woodcut Tradition</i> (Washington, D.C.: National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1983)</p>",""
"2856","Artist Biography","<p>Thomas LeClear was born in the village of Candor, near Oswego, in upstate New York, and demonstrated an early interest in painting. According to Henry T. Tuckerman's <i>Book of the Artists,</i> first published in 1867, LeClear, at the age of twelve, completed a painting of Saint Matthew, which was so admired by his neighbors that they were willing to pay him two and a half dollars for copies. In 1832 his family moved to Ontario, Canada, and a few years later LeClear became an itinerant portrait artist and decorative painter in upstate New York and as far west as Green Bay, Wisconsin.</p><p>In 1839 he moved to New York City, "an almost penniless stranger," according to Tuckerman, and opened a studio. He reportedly studied for several years with Henry Inman, who was at that time one of the city's leading artists. By 1847 LeClear, not yet thirty years old, had begun to win substantial recognition for his work. He began exhibiting at the National Academy of Design in 1845, and in the next few years several of his genre paintings were acquired by the American Art Union.</p><p>In 1847 LeClear moved to Buffalo, New York, where he saw possibilities for a successful career in a city with a flourishing commercial port. His calculations proved correct. In short order he became an important member of Buffalo's art community and acquired many wealthy local patrons. A founding member of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy (later to become the Albright-Knox Art Gallery), LeClear served on its board for many years.

"2914","Artist Biography","<P>Edmonia Lewis, an American sculptor who made her career in Italy, brought a new, naturalistic approach to the neoclassical tradition. Her works were infused with both personal relevance and timely human rights issues. At the height of her fame in the late 1860s and 1870s, she captivated both Europeans and Americans. Her sculptures were exhibited from Boston to Chicago to San Francisco as well as in her studio in Rome. Truly, the phrase "lost and found" applies equally to the history of Edmonia Lewis and of her masterpiece, <I>The Death of Cleopatra,</I> [SAAM, 1994.17] carved in 1876.</P>
<P>While it is abundantly clear that Lewis overcame enormous obstacles to become a sculptor, much about her life remains unknown. According to various sources, she was born in either 1843 or 1845, possibly in Newark, New Jersey, or rural New York. Her father was African American and her mother was of Ojibwa (Chippewa) descent, though both parents died within a few years of her birth. She may have been raised for a while by her mother's tribe, but her older brother paid for her education at Oberlin College in Ohio, where she excelled in a drawing course.</P>
<P>Lewis went to Boston in 1863 with letters of introduction in hand. A number of prominent abolitionists facilitated her efforts to become a sculptor. Through the sale of portraits of John Brown and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, she financed a trip to Italy in 1865.</P>
<P>In Rome, Lewis experienced greater artistic freedom as a woman and a black. Although she associated with several well-known American sculptors, including Hiram Powers and William Wetmore Story, Lewis forged closer ties with other women artists who lived there at the time, such as Harriet Hosmer and Anne Whitney. </P>
<P>She became internationally known for her portraits of abolitionists and for her depictions of ethnic and religious themes. Although she returned frequently to America to show and sell her works, Lewis became a permanent expatriate by 1880. By the turn of the century, however, she was virtually forgotten. Lewis was last reported living in Rome in 1911, but where and when she died is unknown. Not until the late 1960s was interest in the artist and her work rekindled.</P>

"2914","Artist Biography","<p>"There is nothing so beautiful as the free forest. To catch a fish when you are hungry, cut the boughs of a tree, make a fire to roast it, and eat it in the open air, is the greatest of all luxuries. I would not stay a week pent up in cities, if it were not for my passion for art." &#8212; Edmonia Lewis, quoted in "Letter From L. Maria Child," <i>National Anti-Slavery Standard</i>, 27 Feb. 1864.</p><br /><p>Edmonia Lewis, the first professional African-American sculptor, was born in Ohio or New York in 1843 or 1845. Her father was a free African-American and her mother a Chippewa Indian. Orphaned before she was five, Lewis lived with her mother's nomadic tribe until she was twelve years old. Lewis's older brother, Sunrise, left the Chippewas and moved to California where he became a gold miner. He financed his sister's early schooling in Albany, and also helped her to attend Oberlin College in Ohio in 1859. While at Oberlin she shed her Chippewa name "Wildfire" and took the name Mary Edmonia Lewis. Her career at Oberlin ended abruptly when she was accused of poisoning two of her white roommates. Lewis was acquitted of the charge, though she had to endure not only a highly publicized trial but also a severe beating by white vigilantes. Subsequently accused of stealing art supplies, she was not permitted to graduate from Oberlin.</p><p>Lewis left Oberlin in 1863 and, again through her brother's encouragement and financial assistance, moved to Boston. There she met the portrait sculptor Edward Brackett under whose direction she began her limited sculptural studies. She was determined to become a sculptor. With a minimum of training, exposure, and experience, Lewis began producing medallion portraits of well-known abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison, Charles Sumner, and Wendell Phillips. With sales of her portrait busts of abolitionist John Brown and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the Boston hero and white leader of the celebrated all-African-American 54th Regiment of the Civil War, Lewis was able to finance her first trip to Europe in 1865.</p><p>After traveling to London, Paris, and Florence, Lewis decided to settle in Rome where she rented a studio near the Piazza Barberini during the winter of 1865 and 1866. When Lewis arrived in Rome, sculptors favored the neoclassical style that was marked by a lofty idealism and Greco-Roman resources. She quickly learned Italian and became acquainted with two prominent white Americans living in Rome, the actress Charlotte Cushman and the sculptor Harriet Hosmer. A number of other American sculptors lived in Rome at this time because of the availability of fine white marble and the many Italian stonecarvers who were adept at transferring a sculptor's plaster models into finished marble products. Lewis was unique among sculptors of her generation in Rome as sherarely employed Italian workmen, and completed most of her work without assistance. Her motivation was probably twofold: lack of money and fear of the loss of originality in her work.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of Lewis's sculptures have not survived. Portrait busts of abolitionists and patrons such as Anna Quincy Waterston, and subjects depicting her dual African-American and Native American ancestry were her specialty. Lewis also completed several mythological subjects or "fancy pieces" such as <i>Asleep,</i> <i>Awake,</i> and <i>Poor Cupid,</i> and at least three religious subjects, including a lost <i>Adoration of the Magi</i> of 1883, and copies of Italian Renaissancesculpture.</p><p>Her <i>Moses,</i> copied after Michelangelo, is an example of Lewis's imitative talents; the sensitively carved <i>Hagar</i> (also known as <i>Hagar in the Wilderness</i>) is probably the masterpiece among her known surviving works. In the Old Testament, Hagar&#151;Egyptian maidservant to Abraham's wife Sarah&#151;was the mother of Abraham's first son Ishmael. The jealous Sarah cast Hagar into the wilderness after the birth of Sarah's son Isaac. In Lewis's sculpture Egypt represents black Africa, and Hagar is a symbol of courage and the mother of a long line of African kings. That Lewis depicted ethnic and humanitarian subject matter greatly distinguished her from other neoclassical sculptors.</p><p>Newspaper accounts reveal that Lewis returned to the United States in 1872 to attend an exhibition of her works at the San Francisco Art Association. The San Francisco <i>Pacific Appeal</i> reported that Lewis was in the United States again in October 1875, and made a brief appearanceat a concert held in St. Paul, Minnesota. After 1875, facts concerning the remainder of Lewis's life as well as the date and place of death are obscure and conflicting. She never married, had no children, and was last reported living in Rome in 1911.</p><p>Lewis greatly admired the poetry of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and was especially attracted to his epic poem, <i>The Song of Hiawatha.</i> Lewis completed at least three figural groups inspired by the poem: <i>The Wooing of Hiawatha,</i> <i>The Marriage of Hiawatha and Minnehaha,</i> and <i>The Departure of Hiawatha and Minnehaha.</i> While in Rome in 1869, Longfellow visited Lewis's studio where he sat for a portrait and probably saw the sculptures his poem inspired. Until recently the only surviving known work from Lewis's <i>Hiawatha and Minnehaha</i> series was a pair of small busts of the young lovers, which were probably studies for the figurative groups. In 1991, however, Lewis's <i>Marriage of Hiawatha and Minnehaha</i> was rediscovered.</p><p>Regenia A.

"2921","Artist Biography","<p>During the mid-1940s New York painter Norman Lewis abandoned the social realist style that he had pursued for more than a decade, having decided that painting "an illustrative statement that merely mirrors some of the social conditions" was not an effective agent for change. Around 1946 he began exploring an overall, gestural approach to abstraction, establishing himself as the only African American among the first generation of Abstract Expressionist artists.</p><p>Inspired by sources as diverse as music, nature, Chinese, Japanese, and African art, and modern painters from Wassily Kandinsky to Mark Tobey, Lewis freely experimented with varying approaches to abstraction. Although representational associations had diminished as his point of departure by the early 1960s, his mature works such as <i>Evening Rendezvous</i> [SAAM, 1994.32] nonetheless combine a haunting sense of figurative presence and the immaterial. Here, a rhythmic tracery of lines, blurred and skittering, hints at standing and mounted figures moving processionally through a dusky mist of refined yet sensuous layers of color.</p><p>Beneath the formal elegance of <i>Evening Rendezvous, </i>however, runs the subtle inflection of Lewis's lifelong political activism and humanitarian concerns. One of several paintings inspired by the Ku Klux Klan, the work alludes to the organization's clandestine activities. During the 1960s and 1970s, Lewis continued to explore his response to the issues and events of the Civil Rights movement in a group of black-and-white abstractions that evolved from his powerful Klan-related paintings. Now the subject of reappraisal, Lewis's works establish the degree to which his poetic sensibility and social consciousness informed his improvisational synthesis of gesture, line, and color.</p><p>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan <i>African-American Art: 19th and 20th-Century Selections</i> (brochure.

"2931","Artist Biography","<p>Those of us who never had the opportunity to meet Roy Lichtenstein in person probably first encountered him in the historical accounts of the 1960s. According to the now-familiar narrative of American art in the Kennedy era, he burst onto the scene in 1962 with his first one-man show at the Leo Castelli Gallery and reigned with Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist as the triumvirate of New York Pop art. Like them, he wanted his pictures "to look programmed or impersonal," reflecting the detachment of American consumer culture at that moment. Unlike them, however, he retained an ironic distance from the Pop myth. "I don't really believe I'm being impersonal when I do it" is the way he qualified it.  From then on, Lichtenstein strove to make art that explored and bridged a series of contradictory positions&mdash;personal and impersonal, high and low, semiotic and existential. His work in fact synthesizes many of the dominant themes of art in the United States during this century, from concern with the common culture that characterized the American Scene painters of the 1930s to obsession with the media in the 1990s.</p><p>Born in 1923, Lichtenstein grew up in New York City and studied briefly with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, an experience that apparently left an indelible mark on his subject matter. He went away to college at Ohio State University and returned home to find a radically different art world. "I was brought up on abstract expressionism," he explained,  "and its concern with forming and interaction is, I think, extremely important." This philosophy led to the pivotal moment in 1960 when he painted a Mickey Mouse embedded in an abstract expressionist matrix. In 1961, comics and advertising images emerged to fill the frames, and a few years later he rejected Mickey and Popeye for soap opera-like comics of his own design. Here, of course, the real subject is not "the drowning girl" who would "rather sink than call Brad for help" (to cite the caption from his famous painting of that title, 1963, Museum of Modern Art, New York).  Rather it is the power of media's language&mdash;its ability to translate and transform.(1)</p><p>Grounded ultimately in the fine rather than the commercial arts, Lichtenstein ranged back and forth across the history of art as freely as he did across advertising and comics. In a characteristically American gesture, he felt the need to engage in an extended dialogue with the European tradition. One by one he revisited the revered figures, essaying works by Matisse and Picasso with skill and wit. Nor did he limit himself to the confines of Western art: a recent exhibition featured  his refashioning of Chinese imagery rendered in the signature Ben Day dots.(2) In these works, as before, the pictorial style becomes the subject.</p><p>Roy Lichtenstein was engaged in a life-long exploration of the ways in which images speak to us. His art transcends the decade of the sixties and establishes his status as an American master of the twentieth century.</p><p>Notes<br />1.

Now don't forget to give Him credit."&#151;"Sister Gertrude," <i>The New Orleans States-Item,</i> 1 Sept. 1973.</p><br /><p>A former street preacher who became an artist, poet, and musician, Gertrude Morgan painted biblical themes to illustrate her gospel teachings. Born on April 7, 1900, in Lafayette, Alabama, Morgan moved to New Orleans during the late 1930s following a separation  from her "earthly" husband. In New Orleans she became affiliated with the Holiness and Sanctified denomination, a loosely organized religious group that praised God through music and dancing. Morgan adopted the title "Sister" during the early 1940s when she became associated with two other street missionaries, Mother Margaret Parker and Sister Cora Williams. As a result of contributions and offerings from their combined street preaching, the three women purchased land, built a chapel, and opened a child-care center in the Gentilly section of New Orleans. For more than twelve years they furnished food and shelter to orphans, runaways, and children of working mothers. The center was destroyed by a hurricane in 1965. After the center closed, Morgan moved to St. Bernard Parish and became the nurse-companion of an elderly woman who owned the tiny house that later became Morgan's Everlasting Gospel Mission.</p><p>In 1965 Morgan had a vision of the Holy Ghost that revealed she was the chosen bride of God. After that, Morgan wore only white to symbolize her spiritual marriage&#151;a crisp nurse's uniform, nurse's oxfords, white stockings, and a small peaked cap perched on her mixed gray hair.</p><p>Sister Gertrude Morgan worked with any available materials at hand when the "spirit" moved her&#151;cardboard, window shades, styrofoam trays, plastic utensils, jelly glasses, blocks of wood, lamp shades, picture frames, her guitar case, and even the back of a "For Sale" sign placed in her yard by a real estate agent.  She freely intermingled acrylics, poster paint, watercolors, wax crayons, and ball-point pen. An integral part of her composition, Morgan's calligraphy was used to convey important messages or to denote specific scriptures that she illustrated. Though as a child she drew designs on the ground with sticks, and later drew pencil designs and painted on paper, she did not begin to paint seriously until 1956.</p><p>The majority of Morgan's paintings are religious. She painted scores ofself-portraits, depicting her before and after her mystical marriage, wearing black and white, respectively. God is always depicted as white in Sister Gertrude's paintings, and she is represented as an African American. Morgan always signed but never dated her works, and used the designations "Jesus" and "God" interchangeably in her paintings. Her prodigious output may be divided into early, middle, and late periods as dictated by style, medium, and content.</p><p>After 1970 Morgan painted scenes almost exclusively inspired by the Bookof Revelation, which deals with the Second Coming of Christ. Her favorite theme depicts the New Jerusalem as described in Revelation: And, I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." Morgan's "New Jerusalem" paintings invariably include a large multistory building shown in cross section to reveal empty chambers, Christ preparing for His marriage to Sister Gertrude, the wedding ceremony, and finally the bridal couple relaxing on a terrace. Morgan also completed a group of large frieze-like, narrative paintings that she called "charters" and illustrated with consecutive chapters from the Book of Revelation.</p><p>Sister Gertrude also created a group of hand-made, painted fans that she gave to friends and handed out during sessions in her all-white Prayer Room. The fans were made of oblong strips of cardboard, stitched together and painted on both sides. Visitors to Sister Gertrude's tiny mission were ushered into her Prayer Room where she alternately preached and sang her prayer songs.</p><p>Gertrude Morgan's paintings and painted objects express her vivid imagination, innate sense of color and composition, and fervent religiosity. Like many self-taught artists, whether white or black, Sister Gertrude Morgan's fundamentalist and pentecostal beliefs were central to her art. During the summer of 1980 Sister Gertrude died peacefully in her sleep. She left no known survivors.</p><p>Regenia A.

The sale, in turn, led Lucioni to Vermont and a commission from Mrs. J. Watson Webb, co-founder of the Shelburne Museum. Rural Vermont reminded him of northern Italy, but by then the two had perhaps become conflated in Lucioni's mind in a more meaningful way. The hills of Vermont struck a home chord because they also signified certain "American" values that were important to him. The act of painting rural Vermont, therefore, became a way of reinforcing those values, and, not incidentally, of marking his achievement in this country. In 1939, Lucioni bought a farmhouse and barn near Manchester Depot.

The child sits with objects symbolizing her youth and inexperience: a clock whose hands indicate her age, a parchment suggesting her unwritten future, and a budding stem representing her undeveloped state.

"3079","Artist Biography","<p>Maldarelli immigrated to the United States from his native Naples as a child. At fourteen he took lessons in drawing and clay modeling, and after two years began study at the National Academy of Design with Leon Kroll, Ivan Olinsky, and Hermon McNeil. In 1912 he entered the Beaux-Arts Institute, where Jo Davidson and Elie Nadelman became particular influences. A classicist with modern tendencies, Maldarelli's early abstract work reflected a brief flirtation with primitivism; but in 1935 he became dissatisfied with the separation of form and content and turned to figural work. Maldarelli is best known for sculptures of female forms in which volume, mass, and contour are overriding concerns. A teacher at Columbia University for many years, Maldarelli received a number of sculptural commissions throughout the 1940s and 1950s.</p><p>Virginia M.

He envisions the possibility of high-speed transit via rocket-powered vehicles traveling through underground tubes. His work is also characterized by his use of symmetry, multiple spatial references, and captions that help clarify the subject of the painting. These traits are all evident in <i>San Francisco to New York,</i> [SAAM, 1986.65.126] which portrays a terminal where travelers of the future will be able to traverse thousands of miles in an hour or less.</p><p>The cruciform terminal is shown as if seen from above, with announcements oftrips to New York and Mexico displayed on billowy tunnel sections that run through the terminal building. With flags flying and travelers coming and going, Maldonado's scene is filled with movement and energy.

The tubes also represent conveyances for the "Canada-United States-Mexico" trip.

"3094","Artist Biography","<P>To most, Man Ray was a mystery. In part, this was the enigma posed by any expatriate who deliberately separates himself from home. In part, it was the confusion that resulted from the multifaceted activities of an artist who accomplished, with easy dexterity, so much. As a painter, a maker of objects, photographer, filmmaker, a participant in avant-garde circles on two continents, Man Ray was dazzling in the multiplicity of his talents.</P>
<P>After almost a decade as a participant in New York's modernist movement, he left for Paris in 1921. There, he established his reputation on an ability to facilitate the ideas of the avant-garde. He endured where most expatriates did not, and for nearly twenty years he integrated himself into an art world of international proportions. In Europe Man Ray succeeded, an American artist of diverse talents. His art slid back and forth from dada revolt to surrealist iconography, from formal aesthetics to commercial design; his technique was whatever he chose, and he was dedicated to the creative idea rather than any particular style or medium. Yet it was not unusual for Man Ray to return repeatedly to a specific motif, as he did with the omniscient eye of the metronome object [see <I>Indestructible Object,</I> SAAM, 1993.43], reworking it in different media and producing multiple versions that each possessed their own beauty and mystery. Perpetuating his ideas for more than half a century, he produced a prodigious oeuvre that was as influential as it was inscrutable. Ever intriguing, he was always hard to explain. …</P>
<P>Man Ray's unusual approach to the arts manifested itself from the beginning. Early in his career, he thought of himself as a "Thoreau breaking free of all ties and duties to society." Taking in the exhibitions at Alfred Stieglitz's Gallery 291 and witnessing the phenomenal 1913 New York Armory Show, Man Ray was quick to absorb the new lessons of modernism beginning to flood New York from Europe. He was impressed by paintings that suggested new ways to depict space within the confines of a canvas, works that rearranged the structure of a figure or a landscape into a loose harmony of lines, planes, and colors, extending the impact of a painting beyond the bounds of mere representation. Nothing as provocative had been offered to young American painters, and Man Ray instinctively grasped the possibilities. …</P>

"3096","Artist Biography","<P>By the time he was fifteen years old, Paul Manship had decided he wanted to become a sculptor. He was born the day before Christmas, in 1885, in St. Paul, Minnesota, the youngest of seven children. After attending Mechanical Arts High School, he took evening classes at the St. Paul Institute School of Art, but left to work as a designer and illustrator.</P>
<P>In 1905 he enrolled in the Art Students League in New York City and after a few months of formal study became an assistant to the sculptor Solon Borglum, whom he considered a critical influence on his work. After further study he received a three-year scholarship to study in Rome where he fell under the spell of Greek antiquity and the beauty of classicism. He traveled extensively before returning to the United States in 1912 where he became an immediate success, launching a career that would last fifty years.</P>
<P>The critics and public unanimously acclaimed him a major new talent. There was a rising tide of enthusiasm for his graceful work, and he sold all of the ninety-six bronze statutes he showed in his first exhibition. One year later he received his first important commissions for garden and architectural sculpture from New York architects.</P>
<P>Early in his career Manship became attracted to animal sculptures and showed a great interest in mythical stories and characters. He became known for his freely modeled forms and dramatic gestures. "I like to express movement in my figures. It's a fascinating problem which I'm always trying to solve," he said. He also noted, "I'm not especially interested in anatomy, though naturally I've studied it. And, although I approve generally of normally correct proportions, what matters is the spirit which the artist puts into his creation—the vitality, the rhythm, the emotional effect."</P>
<P>Some of Manship's well-known works are the <I>Prometheus Fountain</I> in Rockefeller Center, the gates to the entrances of the Bronx Zoo and the Central Park Zoo, and the <I>Time and Fates Sundial</I> and <I>Moods of Time</I> sculptures installed in front of Trylon and Perisphere at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City.</P>

She studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1949 and at both the New School for Social Research and the Hans Hofmann School from 1951 to 1954. Marisol's carved and painted sculpture became associated in the early 1960s with Pop Art, although her sculpture has little to do with the notions about mass production and signage for which Pop is famous. Instead, her work satirically commented on contemporary social and political attitudes and depicted subjects ranging from socialites, celebrities, and political figures to a migrant dust bowl family in search of work. After several years abroad, Marisol returned to the United States in the early 1970s and concentrated on beautifully crafted mahogany sculpture of sharks, barracudas, and other forms of marine life all bearing the image of the artist's face. In recent years, in mixed media assemblages, Marisol has portrayed such creative legends as Georgia O'Keeffe and Martha Graham and has also imaginatively adapted imagery from Old Master paintings.</P>

"3151","Artist Biography","<p>Alice Trumbull Mason became a staunch advocate of nonobjective art early in her career, and throughout her life she believed in its truthfulness over representational art. Born to an affluent family in Litchfield, Connecticut, Mason was a descendant of the American painter John Trumbull. Her mother had studied art in Paris in the 1880s, and her sister had studied with Fernand L&eacute;ger and Hans Hofmann. In 1921 and 1922, Mason studied at the British Academy in Rome. Upon her return to New York in 1924, she entered Charles Hawthorne's classes at the National Academy of Design. Mason's artistic conversion came, however, as a student of Arshile Gorky at the Grand Central Art School from 1927 to 1931. Though his own work was not yet abstract, Gorky introduced Mason to the analytical aspects of Cubism and the spiritual approach of Kandinsky. During a trip to Italy and Greece in 1928, Mason was profoundly affected by Byzantine mosaics and archaic Greek sculpture. She admired the mosaics for their use of plastic elements and materials as expressive devices. She especially noted the use of line to generate motion and gilded tesserae to enhance the stylization of the line, qualities she adopted in herown untitled mosaic of 1941.(1)</p><p>In 1929, when Mason was on the brink of making abstract paintings, her mother died. Her mother's death sparked a transition to abstraction in her work, as a "form of transferred or secularized spirituality."(2) Abstraction for spiritual content did not become a predominant concern for Mason; instead she emphasized the potential of the medium to create meaning in her work:</p><p>"We look for nothing mystical or dream-like but the magic in the work itself. Abstract art demands an awareness of the intrinsic use of materials and a fuller employment of these means which build a new imaginative world by using them for their own potential worth."(3)</p><p>Mason's work from the 1930s and early 1940s shows an artist still coming to terms with a personal style. She occasionally borrowed Mir&oacute;'s meandering line and Kandinsky's amorphous color areas. She used line and color with a freedom reminiscent also of Arthur Dove's paintings. Her  works of this period, while few in number, are emotionally expressive and evocative of nature and natural phenomena. After her marriage and the birth of her two children, Mason found very little time for painting. Instead she turned to poetry for self-expression and to literature, particularly French symbolism, for intellectual stimulation. She did, however, become a founding member of the American Abstract Artists and exhibited in its first annual exhibition. An active member into the 1960s, she served as treasurer in 1939, secretary from 1940 to 1945, and in the early 1960s, was president of the group. Among her close friends in the organization were IlyaBolotowsky, whom she had known from student days at the National Academy, Ibram Lassaw, George McNeil, Esphyr Slobodkina, and Balcomb and Gertrude Greene. She also maintained close ties with Albert Gallatin, George L.K. Morris, and Charles Shaw. It was Gallatin who organized her first solo exhibition in 1942 at the Museum of Living Art.</p><p>In her article for the American AbstractArtists 1938 yearbook, entitled "Concerning Plastic Significance, Mason contended that the expressive potential of medium was the most important element within an abstract work of art. She also argued against Surrealism for its reliance on dream imagery and use of materials as "props for narrative."(4) In her own work she explored the relationship of biomorphic forms and expressive line.</p><p>During the mid 1940s, Mason's paintings reflected a new admiration for Mondrian's work. She credited Mondrian, who had arrived in the United States in the fall of 1940, with inspiring her to abandon biomorphism and adopt "straight-edged" shapes.(5) Under his influence, shedeveloped theories about "displacement" and "four-way balance", apparent in her increasing decentralization of image and use of an all-over compositional approach.(6)</p><p>In 1958, after the sudden death of her son, Mason became increasingly introspective. Her works retained a cool intellectuality but became more reductive. She turned toward an expressionist style, remaining steadfast in her rejection of representational imagery and in her belief in the primacy of plasticity.</p><br /><br /><p>1. Alice T.

From 1961 to 1966 he worked on a series of prints based on visits to a mental facility in Providence—many of which comment on humanity robbed of history, age, clothes, and social standing. The influence of Rembrandt, Goya, Daumier, Munch, and Kollwitz can be discerned in Mazur's early work, although during the late 1960s thematic concerns gave way to experimentation with graphic media.

"3243","Artist Biography","<p>George McNeil has described his artistic approach during the 1930s as "a dialogue, not a conflict, between art freedom and control, between an intuitive, painterly evocation of images, and the thoughtful ordering of pictorial elements into abstract form." Attracted to Expressionism while a student at Pratt Institute in the late 1920s, McNeil developed an interest in C&eacute;annesque structuralism and Cubist rationalization of space under Jan Matulka's tutelage at the Art Students League in 1930.(1) When Hans Hofmann joined the league faculty in 1932, McNeil entered his class; and when Hofmann left to establish his own school, McNeil followed.</p><p>It was about this time, McNeil later said, that "without any conceptual awareness of what I was doing, I learned the life premise of modern art, that energies seen in nature could be transformed into their pictorial equivalent, that paintings could assume a life of their own."(2) <i>Figural Composition #2,</i> painted while McNeil was a Hofmann student at the league, is evidence of McNeil's immediate recognition of the implications of Hofmann's artistic ideas. Following closely on the heels of a group of distinctly Cubist paintings, <i>Figural Composition #2,</i> in which a figure is barely discernible within loosely brushed rectangles of color, predates Hofmann's own efforts in this direction by several years.</p><p>Despite his precocious beginning, during the 1930s McNeil alternated between two very different artistic approaches, one structural and Cubist, the other free, figurative Expressionism. Only later did he realize that the decade for him was marked by simultaneous attempts "to embrace formal <i>and</i> expressionist art values." Like many of his contemporaries, he worked for the WPA, but left the project in 1940 to do war-related work in a factory. In the war years he entered the Teachers College of Columbia University and in 1943 received a master's degree.(3) After two years in the navy, McNeil secured, with John Opper's help, a teaching position at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Although he had not painted for almost six years, McNeil stepped easily back into the two directions he had previously explored. At the same time McNeil recognized that he would probably begin to synthesize the two concerns in the future. In 1948, McNeil returned to New York and began teaching at Pratt Institute, where he is now professor emeritus. Although he continued as a member of the American Abstract Artists until 1956, he grew increasingly distant from the organization.</p><p>The mid 1950s was a fertile time for McNeil's art. His ideas crystallized and he found a way to synthesize the competingimpulses that had formed the major part of his work. He began to work spontaneously, without "undue concern for balance, unity and other structural elements."(4)  Building from a figural basis, he aimed to make his forms "plastically and psychologically alive by having lines, shapes and colors bounce with energy."(5) His new paintings, which were exhibited frequently at Charles Egan's gallery and later with the Poindexter Gallery, were well-received critically, but did not sell. Yet, McNeil continued to push the bounds of his art, knitting image and space into energeticunities of paint.</p><p>This new found figurative Expressionism was not the last transformation to overtake McNeil's work. In the early 1970s, his images became disturbing expressions of anxiety, psychological shock, and other troubling states of mind. His most recent paintings&mdash;still dramatic, figurative-based, and filled with energetic color and line&mdash; ameliorate angst with wit, and attest to McNeil's restless search for ever more powerful expressive means.</p><br /><br /><p>1. McNeil first became seriously interested in European modernism when he attended Vaclav Vytlacil's lecture series given at the Art Students League in the winter of 1928&ndash;29. When he left Pratt Institute, before enrolling at the Art Students League, he took time off to study by himself at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He drew from Greek marbles and from casts of the Parthenon sculpture. There he met Arshile Gorky, who was also copying Greek masterworks. The encounter with Gorky further cemented his conviction to pursue modernism.

Appearing in Chicago at the same time was Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which aroused MacNeil's interest in Indians and led to a long trip through the Southwest, during which he studied the history, customs, and ceremonies of the local tribes.  For the next decade, MacNeil  concentrated on Indian subjects in an effort to rehabilitate their image and give his own work more of a national character.

Metcalf, born of working-class parents in Lowell, Massachusetts, studied in Boston at age seventeen with landscapist George Loring Brown and later worked at the museum school. Financial success as a book and magazine illustrator enabled him to travel to Paris and study at the Académie Julian under the conservative tutelage of Boulanger. In 1886 he was the first American painter to spend time at Giverny within the aura of Monet impressionists, but the new style seems to have had little effect on him.</P>
<P>Returning home he spent several years as a portraitist and illustrator and taught many seasons at the Cooper Institute in New York. During these years he led a fitful personal life, with broken marriages and a record of alcoholism. In 1904 he withdrew from society and spent a year in the Maine woods, thinking, painting, and 'drying out'. The effect was revelatory and gave fresh direction and motivation to his efforts. He called it his "Impressionist Renaissance," and he became dedicated to painting the New England landscape with more vibrant, expressive brushwork and a more colorful palette.</P>
<P>Now one of the Ten American Painters, he joined Childe Hassam at Old Lyme, Connecticut, for several years, moving the participants in that community from a tonalist to a more impressionist style. Several seasons were spent with the Cornish, New Hampshire, colony but generally he roamed throughout the New England countryside painting its splendors winter and summer. The "poet laureate" of the New England hills became his popular cognomen. Working often within an unconventional square format, he painted broad, light-filled, delicately colored views of the hills and villages of New England.</P>
<P>He was particularly close to John Twachtman, whose work was stylistically close and who responded sympathetically to Metcalf's recurrent personal dilemmas. After the demise of the Ten, Metcalf remained active as a painter, but his creative periods were interrupted by ill health and a renewed drinking problem.</P>

"3295","Artist Biography","<P>Unlike Childe Hassam, whose closely framed studies of picturesque old houses resemble craggy ancestral portraits, Metcalf stood back from his subject and carefully selected architectural and geographic features that projected a pastoral view of old New England. His trademark subjects—church steeples, farms, and small towns nestled in panoramic autumnal landscapes—literally and figuratively "fixed" upper-class anxieties about change and disorder in an era of rapid immigration, industrialization, and urbanization.</P>
<P>Ironically, Metcalf was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, the milltown that became synonymous with modern New England. He apprenticed with the painter George Loring Brown from 1875 to 1876, but soon became interested in spiritualism, rebelled against Browns classical tastes, and moved on to the newly formed Museum School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1877–78). Metcalf's principle instructors at the MFA were the painter Otto Grundmann and anatomist William Rimmer. Metcalf worked in a toned-down palate, when compared with French impressionists, and created visually and thematically accessible images for his well-to-do patrons. He exhibited frequently, as one of "The Ten" and solo in major New York galleries. Popularity did not provide personal stability, however. Metcalf went through his career as a peripatetic, wandering from one New England watering hole to the next. Thrice divorced and often impecunious, Metcalf painted landscapes that depict a harmony absent from his personal life.</P><P>William H. Truettner and Roger B.

"3331","Artist Biography","<p>During the forty years that Kenneth Hayes Miller taught at the Art Students League, he inspired a generation of American painters to find the sources of their art in both the Renaissance and contemporary urban life.

After a trip to Europe he joined the staff at the New York School in 1899, and in 1911 began his teaching career at the League. Miller's early romantic paintings revealed the influence of his friend Albert Pinkham Ryder, but during the second decade of the century he turned to the Renaissance compositional devices and technical media later adopted by Reginald Marsh, Paul Cadmus, Edward Laning, and other Miller prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.

Miller readily adopted an aesthetic similar to that of Frieseke: wistful maidens relaxing in sun-flecked gardens painted with broken strokes in impressionist colors. Repeated diagonals of figures and furniture generally characterize the patterning of his canvases, a dynamic that strengthens their inherent introspection.</p><p>When he came back to the States he taught for a while in Pasadena, California, strongly influencing the impressionist movement just emerging there. After the war he purchased a home in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he remained until his death in 1943. It was his avowed intent to please with his canvases, painting them, he said, "not for the staid environment of museums, but for the comfortable intimacy of people's homes."

"3353","Artist Biography","<p>After a brief and unsuccessful attempt to work with his father as a coal dealer, Minor began studying painting in New York under Alfred C. Howland, a teacher who knew several of the Barbizon artists firsthand. In the mid-sixties, Minor went to Europe to continue his training, remaining for almost ten years. After some experimentation in Paris, he joined the artists' colony at Barbizon, where he was a disciple of Narcisse Diaz. He subsequently studied at the Antwerp Academy in Belgium under Joseph van Luppen. Minor traveled extensively in Germany and Italy, and spent two years painting landscapes in the south of England. He exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1872 and at the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery in London before returning to the United States in the mid-seventies. Back in New York City, Minor opened a studio on Washington Square. He spent many seasons painting in northern New York, especially at Keene Valley in the Adirondacks, before he settled in Waterford, Connecticut, not far from New Haven. Elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1888, Minor was made a full academician in 1897.</p><p>According to Eugen Neuhaus, Minor lived in Barbizon for three years, although, like many facts surrounding Minor's career, this information is difficult to verify. Minor's most frequent subjects were interior forest scenes treated in a manner first developed by Rousseau and Diaz in the 1840s.  <i>October</i> [SAAM, 1953.3.7] is probably a view of the Fontainebleau forest, a likelihood enhanced by comparison with a similar work now in the Yale University collection, the title of which refers specifically to that site. Ahtough primarily a painter of small bucolic "cabinet pieces," Minor amply demonstrated in <i>A Hillside Pasture</i> [SAAM, 1909.7.47] that he could also handle larger, more ambitious canvases. Nevertheless, despite several comparisons in his lifetime to George Inness, there is little evidence to indicate the Minor was able or willing&mdash;as Inness was&mdash;to develop a mode of expression sufficiently apart from the Barbizon manner to define a style peculiarly his own.</p><p>Peter Bermingham <I>American Art in the Barbizon Mood</I> (Washington, D.C.: National Collection of Fine Arts and Smithsonian Institution Press, 1975)</p>",""

"3421","Artist Biography","<p>A writer and editor as well as a painter and sculptor, George L. K. Morris used various publications as platforms foradvocating abstract art during the 1930s and 1940s. He believed that abstraction offered limitless possibilities for the twentieth century and set about to interpret new forms and ideas in historical terms so they would have special meaning for an American audience. "There is nothing new," he maintained in a 1937 article, "about the quality that we have come to call abstract. . . . In great works of the past there has always been a dual achievement&#151;the plastic, or structural, on the one hand, and the literary (or subject) on the other." When "the veil of subject-matter had been pierced and discarded," he continued, "the works of all periods began to speak through a universal abstract tongue."(1)</p><p>Morris came to his understanding of modern movements firsthand. His frequent trips to Europe and close association with leading Parisian painters and sculptors gave him special authority when arguing the historical basis of their art.</p><p>Often described as a " Park Avenue Cubist," Morris came from a privileged background. He attended Groton and graduated from Yale in 1928, where he studied art and literature and edited the <i>Yale Literary Magazine.</i> He spent the fall semesters of 1928 and 1929 at the Art Students League; in the spring of 1929 he went to Paris with Albert Gallatin and stayed after Gallatin's departure to take L&eacute;ger's and Ozenfant's classes at the Acad&eacute;mie Moderne. In Paris he became a confirmed abstractionist; in his work illusionistic space in figurative paintings yielded to uptilted planes and increasingly to a Cubist fracturing of the picture plane.</p><p>On his return to New York, Morris founded a short-lived cultural and literary magazine called <i>The Miscellany,</i> for which he wrote intelligent and informed art criticism. He continued to travel frequently, often accompanying Gallatin to Paris to buy work for the Gallery of Living Art. He became friendly with Jean H&eacute;lion, who provided introductions to Braque, Picasso, and Brancusi, and he wrote catalogue notes to accompany H&eacute;lion's essayfor the catalogue of the Gallery of Living Art. In 1937 he joined forces with Gallatin, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, and Cesar Domela, to publish an art magazine called <i>Plastique. There, and in the pages of <i>Partisan  Review&mdash;where he served as an editor between 1937 and 1943&mdash;Morris spoke of the cyclical nature of art history and placed contemporary art squarely within a framework of historical evolution. He wrote that during the nineteenth century, when art appealed to a growing middle class insufficiently sophisticated to understand its plastic qualities, it became stuck "in the mire of realism." With C&eacute;zanne and Seurat, who analyzed objects as shapes in space, the modern era began. The time is ripe, Morris continued, "for a complete beginning. The bare expressiveness of shape and position of shape must be pondered anew; the weight of color (and) the direction of line and angle can be restudied until the roots of primary tactile reaction shall be perceived again." Contemporary artists, he maintained, "must strip art inward to those very bones from which all cultures take their life."(2)</p><p>During World War II, Morris worked as a draftsman for a naval architect's firm. After 1947, he devoted his time almost exclusively to painting and sculpture, although he continued to write occasionally. A founding member of the American Abstract Artists, in the late 1940s he also served as the group's president, arranging exhibitions in Europe and Japan as well as in the United States. He continued to be active with the group during the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p>In Morris's own art, L&eacute;ger served as an early model. Although his work never physically resembled that of his teacher, like L&eacute;ger, Morris sought a synthesis of Cubist structure and primitive form. In Morris's work this was reflected in the incorporation of American Indian imagery. During the mid 1930s, he argued for the concrete, and in his paintings juxtaposed hard-edged circular and angular forms in completely nonobjective compositions related to H&eacute;lion's work of the same time. In the early 1940s, he began to reincorporate figurative imagery in his art. In his <i>Posthumous Portrait</i> of 1944, Morris experimented with such non-art materials as tile and linoleum embedded in painted plaster compositions.</p><p>Although Morris exhibited with some frequency during the 1930s and 1940s, his paintings and sculpture received greatest recognition after the war. He remained steadfast in his devotion to his variant form of Cubism, even though many of his friends and colleagues turned to more expressionist styles in the postwar years.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"3446","Artist Biography","<p>Groomed from childhood for a life as a concert pianist, Roy Moyer is essentially self-taught as a visual artist. He received undergraduate and graduate academic degrees from Columbia University and, following military service during World War II, studied at the University of Oslo. From 1947 until 1950 Moyer lived in Salonica, Greece, where his first exhibition was held. Moyer served as director of the American Federation of Arts from 1963 until 1972, and is currently chief of art and design for UNICEF. A thematic traditionalist, Moyer paints still lifes, landscapes, and figures with a reductive sense of form, and emphasizes the rhythmic contours rather than details of his subjects. If Moyer's work has a visual precedent, it is the expressive use of line and color characteristic of Edvard Munch, although Moyer seldom seeks the psychological intensity found in the Norwegian expressionist's work. The glowing hues of Moyer's recent paintings create illusions of space through color alone.</p><p>Virginia M.

"3467","Artist Biography","<P>At the age of seventeen, Murphy left Oswego, New York, and found a job in Chicago as a painter of advertising billboards. He soon returned to the East, spending several years near Orange, New Jersey, where he taught a group of students during the summer. In 1875 he opened a studio in New York City and the following year exhibited for the first time at the National Academy of Design, to which he was thereafter an annual contributor. His election to the Salmagundi Club in 1878 was the beginning of nearly fifty years of close association with that group. After being awarded the second Hallgarten Prize at the National Academy in 1885, he was elected a full academician two years later. In 1887 he built a studio in the Catskills at Arkville, New York, where he spent his summers and autumns. His winter studio was in the Chelsea district of New York. Murphy's numerous awards include a medal at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago; the Evans Prize of 1894 at the American Water Color Society; a silver medal at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo; a gold medal at the Charleston Exposition in 1902; and a silver medal at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915.</P>
<P>An affable, even-tempered man who made friends easily, Murphy nevertheless spent most of his professional life in seclusion and was one of the first important painters after Thomas Cole to actually reside in the Catskills. Although no one can praise Murphy for being a multifaceted landscapist, his innumerable versions of barren, wasted fields and farms have about them a dry, plaintively lyrical quality that continues to endear him to viewers who do not demand more drama or color in their art. Contemporary taste tends to favor Murphy's small, warmly colored paintings from the late 1880s and 1890s, although in his lifetime Murphy received greater acclaim for a lengthy series of Indian summer landscapes, such as his <I>The Sprout Lot,</I> [Smithsonian American Art Museum] which usually date from the early years of the twentieth century and were painted in thin browns and grays over a studiously prepared ground. Although both chided and praised for his superficial resemblance to Corot, Murphy can best be appreciated and understood when his work is compared to that of other likeminded American painters, particularly Bruce Crane, Henry Ranger, and to a lesser degree, George Inness and Alexander Wyant.</P>

That same year he made his first trip to the Yosemite Valley.</p><p>In direct competition with Carleton Watkin's acclaimed Yosemite views of 1861&ndash;62 (Plate 26), Muybridge's fifty-one mammoth plates, made in 1872, confirmed his reputation as a preeminent landscape photographer.  They were ofered for sale by the San Francisco gallery of Bradley and Rulofson the following year.  Perhaps to distinguish his work from that of other photographers of Yosemite, such as Watkins and Charles Leander Weed (plate 27), Muybridge chose points of view that heighten dramatic intensity.  His photographs are notable for the inaccessibility of the subject matter.  "He has gone to points where his packers refuse to follow him," wrote one observer.</p><p>In 1872 Muybridge accompanied landscape painter Albert Bierstadt and geologist Clarence King, who was completing his survey of the fortieth parallel.  Public response to the 1872 photographs was highly favorable.  According to one critic, the photographs "surpassed in artistic excellence, anything that has yet been published in San Francisco."  Muybridge's stereo-card business, which made his images available in a popular format, flourished.</p><p>Muybridge's views of Yosemite attracted the attention of Leland Stanford, former governor of California and president of the Central Pacific Railroad, who in 1872 commissioned him to photograph Stanford's horse Occident at a gallop in order to determine if a running horses's feet are ever off the ground simultaneously.  These studies led to the extensive stop-action photographs of humans and animals in motion, for which Muybridge is now most famous.</p><p>In 1875 Muybridge traveled to Central and South America as a photographer for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.

"3583","Artist Biography","Elizabeth Nourse's considerable reputation as a Salon painter was acquired in Paris during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when that city was the leading international art center. Nourse was acclaimed by her fellow artists and the public alike, not only for her technical skill but also for the unique personal vision she brought to her subject matter.</p><p>She was one of the first American women to be elected a member of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and she won many awards in the international expositions of the time, in Chicago, Nashville, Paris, Saint Louis, and San Francisco. She was consistently invited to enter the annual juried exhibitions that were a prominent feature of the American art scene&mdash;at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Carnegie Institute, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cincinnati Art Museum, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art. As a final accolade the French government bought her painting <i>Les volets clos</i> for its permanent collection of contemporary art to hang in the Mus&eacute;e  du Luxembourg with the work of such artists as James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Winslow Homer, and John Singer Sargent.</p><p>Nourse's career parallels that of other expatriate artist of the pre-World War I period, but certain aspects of it are unique. With Mary Cassatt and Cecilia Beaux, she was one of the few women painters to achieve international recognition for her work and, like them, faced certain obstacles that a male artist did not encounter. She first had to prove that she was a serious professional since most women painters, now matter how gifted, were considered "Sunday painters" who would eventually marry or become teachers and fail to produce a significant body of work. To acquire professional status she had to be recognized by the all-male juries of the Salons and international exhibitions and to be favorably reviewed by the art critics, who also were mostly men.  As a Victorian lady she could not easily advance her career by forming friendships in these groups, as a male artist could; the social interchange of the caf&eacute;, so much a part of the artistic life of Paris in her day, was denied to her. To compensate for these disadvantages, she always had the total support of her family and of a large network of women friends who admired her work, publicized it, and bought it.</p><p>Unlike Cassatt, Nourse did not have an independent income nor did she teach, as Beaux did. Yet from 1883 until her death in 1938, a period of fifty-five years, she earned her living as a professional artist and supported her older sister, Louise, as well.  She was also unusual among both men and women expatriates in being almost entirely American trained. Except for a few months' study in New York and later in Paris at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian (where critics told her she needed no further schooling), her style was formed at the McMicken School of Design in Cincinnati.</p><p>When Nourse went to Paris in 1887 it was the Mecca for all aspiring young artists who hoped to refine their drawing techniques and to absorb the newest ideas in the contemporary art world. French academic training centered on drawing from the nude, and Nourse could already draw a convincing figure when she arrived. &#133; </p><p>Nourse had not only developed an individual technique before she went to Paris but had also found her subject matter. Her interest in the peasant themes so popular among the Salon painters of her day was simply an extension of her preoccupation with the simple subjects she had painted in the Midwest&mdash;the daily routine of rural folk, especially women at work, mothers and children, portraits of Negro women and girls, and country landscapes.</p><p>Like every memorable artist, Nourse was able to express in her work an original personal vision that is immediately evident to the viewer, who may know nothing about her life. Her biography explains, however, why she brought such deep conviction to her portrayal of working people, particularly to women; to the importance of motherhood; and to the beauty found in the simplest aspects of daily life and of nature. These subjects, banal in the hands of someone less sincere and less skilled, reflected her basic values and Nourse was able to infuse them with a special sense of their importance and their universal meaning.</p><p>Mary Alice Heekin Burke and Lois Marie Fink <i>Elizabeth Nourse, 1859&ndash;1938: A Salon Career</i> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press for the National Museum of American Art and the Cincinnati Art Museum, 1983)</p>",""

Until 1924, the year of her marriage to Stieglitz, O'Keeffe's drawings and paintings in watercolor and oil were frequently abstract. But her artistic language broadened to include representational subjects, usually taken from nature and often painted in series. Visiting Taos in 1929 as the guest of Mabel Dodge Luhan, O'Keeffe discovered new interpretations of light and shadow and began to extract and simplify the monumental natural forms and architecture of the Southwest.

"3600","Artist Biography","<p>O'Sullivan began his photography career as an apprentice in Mathew Brady's Fulton Street gallery in New York City and then moved on to the Washington, D.C., branch managed by Alexander Gardner. In 1861, at the age of twenty-one, O'Sullivan joined Brady's team of Civil War photographers. When Gardner left Brady, O'Sullivan went with him, working for Gardner until the end of the war. Several of his images were included in <i>Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.</i> O'Sullivan built his reputation on images that conveyed the destructive power of modern warfare. His photographs of Forts Fisher and Sedgwick suggest the dismal psychological as well as physical effect of continual barrages of distant cannon fire on the soldiers behind the barricades.</p><p>In 1867 O'Sullivan joined Clarence King's geological survey of the fortieth parallel&mdash;the first federal expedition in the West after the Civil War. The letter of authorization, dated March 21, 1867, from Brigadier General A. A. Humphreys, chief of engineers, Department of War, charged King "to direct a geological and topographical exploration of the territory between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, including the route or routes of the Pacific railroad." O'Sullivan was strongly influenced by King's interest in the arts (he was a member of the Ruskinian group, the Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art), as well as by contemporary science and its attendant controversies. His work for the King survey often functioned as both objective scientific documentation and a personal evocation of the fantastic and beautiful qualities of the western landscape.</p><p>In 1871 O'Sullivan joined the geological surveys west of the one hundredth meridian, under the command of Lieutenant George M. Wheeler of the U.S. Corps of Engineers. An army man rather than a civilian scientist like King, Wheeler insisted on a survey that would be of practical value. His reports included information likely to be useful in the establishment of roads and rail routes and the development of economic resources. Wheeler's captions for O'Sullivan's pictures provide geological information but also emphasize that the West was a hospitable place for settlers. For example, he compared Shoshone Falls favorably to Niagara Falls, the most popular American symbol of nature's grandeur. Indeed, O'Sullivan's 1874 image of Shoshone Falls, a version of a nearly identical image of the falls he made for King six years before in 1868, emphasized perspective as picturesque as it was dramatically precipitant.</p> <p>Flat-bottomed boats were used to go up the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon to the mouth of Diamond Creek. O'Sullivan commanded one of the boats, which he christened <i>The Picture.</i> Many of his negatives on glass plates were lost in transport, but surviving views of the Colorado's canyons are among his finest.</p><p>In 1873 O'Sullivan led an independent expedition for Wheeler, visiting the Zuni and Magia pueblos and the Canyon de Chelly, with its remnants of a cliff-dwelling culture.  O'Sullivan's 1873 images of Apache scouts are among the few unromanticized pictures of the western Indian, unlike those of many ethnographic photographers who posed Indians in the studio or outdoors against neutral backgrounds.</p><p>Merry A.

He also studied during the summer of 1950 with Max Beckmann at Mills College in Oakland. His early works are mainly expressive in form, color, and line. In 1956 Oliveira began teaching at his alma mater and also at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco. One year later he received a Louis Comfort Tiffany grant for lithography and began more in-depth work in prints. In 1958 he was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship, which enabled him to travel to Europe. As artist in residence at the University of Louisville from 1961 to 1962, Oliveira had a solo exhibition at the university's Krannert Museum. From 1963 to 1964, he was a visiting lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles, after which he accepted a permanent teaching position at Stanford University. Oliveira became interested in monotypes about 1972 after seeing an exhibition catalogue on Degas's work in this medium.

"3627","Artist Biography","<p>John Opper described the 1930s as a "great gestation period" for his art. "I thought the Thirties was a very vital time for American art. . . . With the WPA, you got together whether it was the [Artists'] Union or the [American Artists'] Congress or whether it was a bar. . . and you talked about art, and you heard about important artists, and you began to live art."(1) But Opper also remembered the thirties as a period of breakdown in the vitality of American art; "we became aware that a great deal was missing."(2)</p><p>Academically trained like many of his contemporaries, Opper came to New York in 1934, two years after his graduation from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. As a youth, he had taken Saturday art classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art and later studied at the Cleveland School of Art and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. When he arrived in New York he was a well-trained painter, adept at rendering still lifes and particularly landscapes depicting the American scene. A reviewer of his 1937 exhibition at the Artists' Gallery in New York, for example, wrote about Opper's "colloquial flavor &#133; spontaneity and an imaginative use of color which conveys just the feeling" that the subjects&mdash;East River tugboats, old garages, and scenes around  Manhattan&#151; suggested.(3)</p><p>By 1937 Opper had become familiar with modernism, though he was not yet converted to the cause. Indeed, his 1937 show was made up of the still popular regionalist paintings. Earlier, in 1935 and 1936, he studied with Hans Hofmann and began to think in terms of forces and tensions within the picture plane. He met Wilfrid Zogbaum, Giorgio Cavallon, Byron Browne, Rosalind Bengelsdorf, and George McNeil, with whom he shared a studio. He paid frequent visits to Gallatin's Gallery of Living Art. He joined the WPA easel project in 1936 and began to paint in "a kind of transformed cubist style."(4)</p><p>For Opper, though, abstraction conflicted philosophically with a strong commitment to social reform. He belonged to the American Artists' Congress and, when it was first formed, served as business manager of <i>Art Front,</i> the Artists'Union publication. He also exhibited with the American Abstract Artists, but eventually dropped out of the group. Opper said he preferred to combine creative work with social comment and was as yet unwilling to do completely abstract art. During the early 1940s, he noted, he was torn "between the needs of the society and the needs of war on one hand, and on. . . what I felt were the aesthetic needs of painting."(5) Only when he resolved to separate these two did he begin systematically to pursueabstract work. Eventually, he came to believe that the only thing important to art "is that which changes &#133; the language and the substance of it."</p><p>When war came, Opper worked for three years with a marine architectural firm making drawings for the pipe systems of PT boats. After the war, he taught at the University of Wyoming and the University of Alabama, and between 1952 and 1957, he was on the faculty at the University of North Carolina. In 1957, he began teaching at New York University, where he remained until his retirement in 1974.</p><p>Opper had two solo exhibitions during the late 1930s, but it was not until the 1940s that he began to show frequently in large museum exhibitions and receive widespread attention. For Opper, this was a time of maturity. In paintings such as <i>Farmyard</i> (1937), his abstraction was based on nature; <i>Wyoming,</i> however, represents a major conceptual step. By 1947, when it was painted, Opper was committed to the idea that "painting is concerned with painting," an end in itself rather than a means to communicate other concerns. Early on he was allied with the "intuitive" (rather than the rationally inclined) faction within the American Abstract Artists. But Opper moved far afield stylistically from the densely painted, expressionistic works of the 1930s and 1940s. In time, he became known as an Abstract Expressionist, a painter of large canvases in which vertical bands of varying widths pulsed with color. His gesture was controlled, yet dynamic; his overlays of color luminous and tactile. In these works, and in field paintings in which clouds of color seem to float against soft grounds, he strengthened his commitment to "painting as painting" that he first developed as a Hofmann student.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"3638","Artist Biography","<p>Jos&eacute; Benito Ortega, the last of the late 19th-century <i>santeros</i> (religious image-makers), traveled from the 1870s to the early 1900s throughout northern New Mexico making santos (religious images) for small chapels, meeting houses, village homes, and for <i>Penitentes</i> (members of a religious brotherhood). He and other <i>santeros</i> were true itinerant artists at a time when the Catholic Church was attempting to replace the santos with mass-produced plaster statues. By the early 1900s, the old <i>santo</i>-making tradition had died out. Its revival began in the 1920s in Santa Fe when the production of relatively small unpainted pieces for the tourist market was encouraged by Anglo artists and others interested in Hispanic culture. In recent years a new generation of santeros has begun to make polychromed santos comparable in size to the older pieces but largely destined now for museums rather than churches.</p><p>In keeping with the prerevival santero tradition, Ortega's <i>Our Father Jesus of Nazareth</i>[SAAM, 1986.65.258] is relatively large. The figure stands enclosed up to the waist within three boards nailed to the base. Parchment covers the side boards and the figure from waist to mid thigh, forming a short skirt. This supporting "cage," which kept the figure from falling when it was carried in Holy Week processions, would not normally be seen under the full garment and cloak in which it was usually dressed. The wrists are tied with a leather strap. The long, narrow head, with prominent nose and outlined eyes, is typical of Ortega's work.</p><p>The overall effect of this stylized representation of the Christ figure is very powerful. The suffering of Christ is conveyed by the pose of the figure, the slight lowering of the head, the bound hands, and the graphic representation of the bleeding over every part of the body.</p><p><i>Hispanic-American Art</i> (brochure, Washington, D.C.: National Museum of American Art)</p>",""

In spite of this, Ortega continued to produce traditional images for Penitente <i>moradas</i> and for church, chapel, and private use. His crude carving of hands and feet contrasts with the sensitive, individual touch he gave facial features.  In 1907, after the death of his wife, he moved to Raton and ceased making <i>santeros.</i></p><p>References<br />Denver Art Museum. <i>Santos of the Southwest,</i> pp. 36&ndash;42.

<p>Born in 1932 in Seoul, Korea, to a wealthy industrial family, Paik and his family fled Korea in 1950 at the outset of the Korean War, first to Hong Kong, then to Japan. Paik graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1956, and then traveled to Germany to pursue his interest in avant-garde music, composition and performance. There he met John Cage and George Maciunas and became a member of the neo-dada Fluxus movement. In 1963, Paik had his legendary one-artist exhibition at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal, Germany, that featured his prepared television sets, which radically altered the look and content of television.</p>
<p>After immigrating to the United States in 1964, he settled in New York City where he expanded his engagement with video and television, and had exhibitions of his work at the New School, Galerie Bonino and the Howard Wise Gallery. In 1965, Paik was one of the first artists to use a portable video camcorder. In 1969, he worked with the Japanese engineer Shuya Abe to construct an early video-synthesizer that allowed Paik to combine and manipulate images from different sources. The Paik-Abe video synthesizer transformed electronic moving-image making. Paik invented a new artistic medium with television and video, creating an astonishing range of artworks, from his seminal videotape <i>Global Groove</i> (1973) that broke new ground, to his sculptures <i>TV Buddha</i> (1974), and <i>TV Cello</i> (1971); to installations such as <i>TV Garden</i> (1974), <i>Video Fish</i> (1975) and <i>Fin de Siecle II</i> (1989); videotapes <i>Living with the Living Theatre</i> (1989) and <i>Guadalcanal Requiem</i> (1977/1979); and global satellite television productions such as <i>Good Morning Mr. Orwell,</i> which broadcast from the Centre Pompidou in Paris and a WNET-TV studio in New York City Jan. 1, 1984.</p>

"3714","Artist Biography","<p>The women in Paxton's finely detailed interiors, from dowagers and schoolgirls to servants, helped define idealized female roles for upper-class New Englanders at the turn of the century. Calm, introspective, and bathed in quiet light, Paxton's figures provide a striking contrast to the working-class female subjects of New York's Ashcan School. Whereas the well-to-do Boston women read, drink tea, and regard fine things in their quiet homes (while their servants quietly keep house), New York women are seen promenading down bustling streets, flirting openly, and readily catching the eye of passing strangers. Both, however, demand the attention of the viewer: Paxton's women project a compelling but reserved, sensual languor; Ashcan women are depicted as open and engaging.</p><p>As an image maker, Paxton was keenly aware of the social conventions of upper-class Boston, even though he was raised in less privileged circumstances. The son of a suburban caterer, he attended the Cowles Art School on scholarship before making the pilgrimage to Paris to study at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts (with G&eacute;r&ocirc;me) and the Acad&eacute;mie Julian. Like so many of his Boston School colleagues, Paxton was able to use his artistic ability and finely tuned social antennae to achieve a prominence in New England cultural circles that belies his middle-class origins.</p><p>William H.

"3750","Artist Biography","<p>The conjunction between art and commerce that winds through Penn's career challenges our usual definitions of both these areas. Issues of art&mdash;the pursuit of a particular aesthetic standard&mdash;and advertising&mdash;the creation of desire&mdash;are topics usually considered antithetical. Concerned with both, for almost half a century [Irving] Penn has fashioned his career along complex and occasionally mysterious lines.</p><p>Penn's photography is best known through magazines; his first photographs were for the printed page, not the photographic print. Through the influence and resources of his sponsors&mdash;after 1943 predominately Cond&eacute; Nast&mdash;he has made portraits of some of this century's most important artists and has photographed the most beautiful women dressed by the most distinctive couturiers. They have also made possible photographic excursions to places such as Morocco, Peru, and New Guinea, remote from fashion capitals. His still-life arrangements of geometric purity or reclaimed trash were posed in a studio furnished with lights and backdrops that might also have accommodated the demands of a well-organized advertisement for perfume or cosmetics. The interconnections between art and advertising in Penn's work are understandable. How he manages to simultaneously accomplish so much is remarkable; that he weaves with grace and confidence the private thread of personal vision through such enormous range is his rare talent.</p><p>By his own account, [Irving Penn] drifted into the New York commercial art world almost by accident after his design studies at the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art, doing graphic work for his former teacher, an ex-Imperial Russian cavalryman, Alexey Brodovitch, at <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> during the late 1930s. After a short stint as the advertising manager for Saks Fifth Avenue in 1940, a job he inherited from Brodovitch, he retired to Mexico for a year of painting. </p><p>In 1943, art director Alexander Liberman lured him to <i>Vogue</i> as his assistant.  There he learned to use an 8 x 10-inch camera and published his first color image on the magazine cover. Penn demonstrated an ability to create pictorial images that could also communicate an appropriate sense of the product being sold. During his connection with <i>Vogue</i> and Liberman, who would become employer, patron, and collaborator, Penn coaxed a photographic style as strong and personal as a painting style from a medium whose natural tendency is to obscure and dilute the imprint of the photographer. &#133;</p><p>As if some perfect blend of portrait and still life, Penn's fashion photographs proved to be his earliest success. Penn gave his models a kind of character that seemed bound to ideal form, and directed their arrangement with a minimum of ostentation in metaphoric designs. Without doubt, Penn's interpretations of the couturier's art were different from earlier representations of fashion. The revolutionary series of photographs that Penn made of the 1950 Paris collections for <i>Vogue</i> simply but emphatically revised the terms on which future fashion photographs would be considered. &#133;</p><p>Rejecting elaborate settings for fashion, Penn instead placed his models against plain backdrops, destroying any sense of space or scale, leaving the subject of fashion to speak for itself. Penn, now in tune with the new American abstract painters&mdash;by 1950 <i>Vogue</i> had illustrated work by both Jackson Pollock and Mark  Rothko&mdash;sought to isolate his subjects from cultural associations of the prewar years. In his photographs the effect of natural light gave a reality to spare and artificial situations; light delineated every seam of a dress, and the texture of the cloth and the outline of the garments became paramount. A gesture with a long black glove might choreograph and define the space across a page. &#133;</p><p>Just as his fashion photographs are more often like portraits than descriptions of the latest styles, his portraits of the period strip away all the contingency and commonplaces of experience to present the individual style of personality. Working for <i>Vogue,</i> first in New York and then in Europe, in the late 1940s Penn was able to photograph many members of the aging or exiled radical artistic and intellectual elite. Those who had survived the war in Europe were less known, but no less intriguing, to an eager American audience in search of cultural identity. Salvador Dali, Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Andr&eacute; Derain, Pablo Picasso: dashing and exotic, they provided the right mix of stylish creativity appealing to a fashionable audience. The details that Penn provides for them in his images&mdash;electrical cables, the edges of the seamless backdrops, the mysterious substantiality of northern light&mdash;serve as metaphors of the necessarily spare ateliers of the artistic homeless.</p><p>Merry A.

"3761","Artist Biography","<p>More than any other member of the American Abstract Artists, Irene Rice Pereira took to heart the principles of the Bauhaus. Assessing its importance, she wrote in 1939 that the Bauhaus "exerted the greatest influence on our entire social order. . . ."(1) In her paintings, her commitment to machine-age materials, and in a philosophy that called for a merging of technology and the transcendental, she was among the most avid Bauhaus proponents in the United States.</p><p>Pereira had experienced a difficult childhood. Born in Boston in 1902, she began supporting her family at an early age after her father's death.(2) In 1927, while working as a designer during the day, she enrolled in night classes at the Art Students League. Over the next four years, she and fellow students Burgoyne Diller, David Smith, and Dorothy Dehner, came to know modernism through the instruction of Jan Matulka and Richard Lahey. By 1931, Pereira had saved enough money for a trip to Europe and North Africa.(3) She attended criticism sessions given by Am&eacute;d&eacute;e Ozenfant at the Acad&eacute;mie Moderne in Paris. But much of her year abroad was spent traveling&mdash;in Italy, where she studied the brilliant color of Italian Primitive painting, and in North Africa, where the light and dramatic space of the Sahara had a lasting effect on her life and on her aspirations for her art.</p><p>In 1935, Pereira helped found, and began teaching at, the Design Laboratory, a cooperative school of industrial design established under WPA auspices. She believed deeply in art's social function andconsidered abstract art the key to the future:</p><blockquote><i>The importance of abstract art lies in the fact that it is an experimental art&mdash;These artists are not concerned with literary documentation&mdash;but experimentation which conveys its influences to our architecture&mdash;our  typography&mdash;photography&mdash;industrial design&mdash;It is an art which performs a definite social function.</i>(4)</blockquote><p>The curriculum at the Design Laboratory paralleled that of the Bauhaus. Students were required to take a basic course (patterned after the Vorkurs taught by Albers and Moholy-Nagy) that introduced them to the chemistry, physics, and mechanics of traditional as well as new art materials. Much of the instruction took place in laboratories. The students experimented with materials in order to gain a practical grasp of physical properties. They then applied this knowledge to the design of objects that could be easily mass produced. "Truth to the materials" was a basic precept and the use of surface ornament was actively discouraged. Although the traditional media of clay, wood, and stone were listed as materials to be explored in the class schedule, by 1937, Pereira's students were also working in glass, plastic, and metals.</p><p>Inherent in the philosophies of both the Bauhaus and the Design Laboratory was the notion that the individual genius was subordinate to broad social considerations. The needs of society dictated the program. Courses were taught in the social implications of technological developments, as well as the psychology, chemistry, and physics of color. Music, painting, literature, and architecture rounded out the academicschedule.</p><p>Experimentation also lay at the core of Pereira's own artworks. The paintings in her 1933 exhibition at American Contemporary Artists Gallery were semi-abstract compositions based on nautical motifs&mdash;smokestacks, ventilators, anchors, and the like&mdash;while in her 1934 and 1935 exhibitions at ACA she presented canvases in which abstracted human forms were juxtaposed against the shapes of giant machines. <i>Machine Forms #2</i> (also called <i>Power House),</i> and the study that preceded it, are among the last works in this vein. Painted early in 1937, <i>Machine Forms #2</i> was inspired by the view from her studio window: "I used to look in at a power house on 16th Street where I was living, to get the feeling of power house; and then made my own."(5)</p><p>Later in 1937, when Pereira began painting nonobjective canvases, the principles of the Bauhaus and Russian Constructivism became apparent in her work. She was especially concerned with finding a way to bring light into her work, and over the next ten years incorporated a wide range of unusual paints, as well as glass, plastic, gold leaf, and other reflective materials into her art. By 1946 she had experimented with radium paint&mdash;these works would emitghostly patterns when lights were  extinguished&mdash;and she madeglass constructions in which she painted on smooth, pebbled, and corrugated glass surfaces, then layered them together to emphasize a shallow, planar depth.(6)</p><p>Pereira continued to work in an abstract vein for the remainder of her life. She said abstraction offered "a wider range for experimentation and for clarifying the problems concerning pictorial presentation."(7) Increasingly, though, she attempted to articulate her ideas in poetry and essays, the metaphysical tone of which often obscured rather than clarified her thoughts.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"3826","Artist Biography","<p>Perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, Jackson Pollock's work defined America's artistic coming of age. Born in Cody, Wyoming, he first studied art in 1925 in Los Angeles, where he developed an interest in sculpture. By 1929, encouraged by his brother, he moved to New York to pursue painting at the Art Students League under Thomas Hart Benton, who was to remain a supporter throughout Pollock's life. During the thirties Pollock blended his Benton-derived brand of Regionalism with elements of Surrealism. From 1938 to 1940, he worked for the WPA, creating representational murals. Pollock's marriage in 1945 to the artist Lee Krasner, a student of Hans Hofmann's, brought him into closer contact with the New York avant-garde.</p><p>In the early forties Pollock began to exhibit in New York and quickly became a star at Peggy Guggenheim's gallery, Art of This Century. At the time, Pollock was working in a variety of styles, using thick impasto as well as a rather mannered linear approach. But in 1947 he adopted the "drip" painting style for which he is best known. Working with his canvas on the floor and flinging paint, sand, ink, tar, and other materials onto the surface from all angles, Pollock revolutionized the concept of painting with this expressive, direct approach that came to be called "action painting." Both reviled and praised throughout the fifties for his boundary-breaking work, Pollock became the acknowledged leader of the new American movement called Abstract Expressionism.

"3864","Artist Biography","<P>Studied sculpture with Frederick Eckstein, a Prussian artist working in Cincinnati. Repaired and mechanized wax figures for the Western Museum in Cincinnati. 1828, first portrait commissions. 1834, patron Nicholas Longworth sent him to Washington to produce portraits of leading Americans, among them Andrew Jackson; then to Europe, 1836. After Paris, went with family to Florence, 1837. Lived there the rest of his life, never returning to America. <I>The Greek Slave</I> exhibited in London, 1845 and again in 1851, establishing his international reputation. From that date, critical and financial success were assured. Died Florence, 27 June 1873.</P>
<P>In terms of fame and financial success, Hiram Powers was the central American sculptor of the nineteenth century. He achieved this through the development—one might even say the "invention"—of a style that blended classical idealism, physical immediacy, and appealing subject matter with moral overtones. If to our eyes he seems less gifted than some of his colleagues, his place in the history of taste is nonetheless secure. The presence in the NMAA [now the Smithsonian American Art Museum] of the contents of his studio provides special insight not only into his art, but also into the working methods typical of the majority of nineteenth-century sculptors—specifically the use of mechanical devices and professional carvers under the artist's direction.</P>
<P>In his early sculpture, Powers reveals a taste and aptitude for naturalistic rendering. The outstanding example of this probing vision is his bust of Andrew Jackson, a work whose extraordinary incisiveness puts it in the forefront of American portrait sculpture. The sittings were obtained in 1835 through the intervention of his patron, Nicholas Longworth, and they provided Powers with a treasured anecdote as well as a superb likeness. He modeled the original clay bust (the plaster cast of which is now in the NMAA) with a fidelity that made the sixty-eight-year-old Jackson's toothlessness unmistakable. Asked what he thought of this, the president responded: "Make me as I am, Mr. Powers, and be true to nature always. It is the only safe rule to follow. I have no desire to look young as long as I feel old; and then it seems to me…that the only object in making a bust is to get a representation of a man who sits, that it be as nearly as possible a perfect likeness. If he has not teeth, why then make him with teeth?" What makes both the bust and quotation remarkable is that Powers's naturalism, stunningly successful as it was, was progressively and rapidly abandoned by the sculptor.</P>
<P>By 1842, he had produced his first idealized female nude, <I>Eve Tempted.</I> The choice of subject permitted nudity without offending Victorian morality. In order to reconcile the conflict between pagan-inspired nudity and contemporary prudery, the artist explained to Elizabeth Barrett Browning that "the nude statue should be an unveiled soul." The purity of the marble, from Seravezza—a quarry about eighteen miles from Carrara—lent itself to spiritual idealism, while its quasi-flesh tone (as the sculptor saw it) together with Powers's careful simulation of skin texture conjured a physical reality. The notable lack of originality in "formal" invention or composition, however, vitiates Powers's ambitious intention in Eve. With a serpent decorously draped around the sculpture's base and up the supporting tree trunk, the figure looks at the apple in her flaccid hand with unsurpassed blandness—neither curious, nor distrustful, nor even hungry. Her left hand holds another apple, perhaps from one of the "approved" trees in the Garden.</P>
<P>It is fascinating to note the presence of drill points in Eve's hair, indicating that although it was Powers's first ideal statue he never completed it. Remarkably, the sculpture survived shipwreck off the coast of Spain and was salvaged almost undamaged. Although Powers returned to the subject, he never replicated <I>Eve Tempted.</I></P>
<P>Like George Inness, Powers was a Swedenborgian. Emanuel Swedenborg's theosophical writings had in the nineteenth century a remarkable following in many countries. Powers had encountered the New Church of Swedenborg's advocates in Cincinnati (his sculpture tutor, Frederick Eckstein was one), and he remained close to the society throughout his life. Swedenborg's tenet that "the form of the spirit of man is the human form" is clearly behind Powers's equating of the naked body with the "unveiled soul."</P>
<P>No naked body as unveiled soul more impressed the public, both in England and America, than <I>The Greek Slave.</I> Although banned in Boston, a roster of clergymen vouched for its purity. Essentially, the artist had managed to introduce taboo nudity under the sanction of sentimental morality. With its reference to the Turkish conquest of Greece, <I>The Greek Slave</I> suggested the intellectual superiority of Western culture, the spiritual superiority of Christianity, and (to more heated imaginations) the erotic debaucheries then often associated with the Near East. This colonial attitude, as we may call it, is implicit in Powers's published description of the sculpture, which invoked Divine Providence, noted the slave's "scorn for all [the Turks] around her," and concluded, "It is not her person but her spirit that stands exposed."</P>
<P>Both of the plaster models for <I>The Greek Slave</I> are in the NMAA. The "original" plaster was made from Powers's own clay model, the "true original," which was destroyed in the process of casting the plaster. The plaster differs from the marble replicas (of which there are six) only in the omission of the manacles. The pattern of metal points protruding from the plaster was transferred to a marble block by the use of a pointing machine. The sculpture could thus be reproduced exactly in marble and then given its finish.</P>
<P>Nathaniel Hawthorne, reporting on an 1858 visit to Powers's studio, explained that although he saw two casts of the Uffizi Venus de' Medici there, the artist asserted "that the sculptor of the Venus de' Medici did not know what he was about." It is a remarkable statement considering that Powers's <I>Greek Slave</I> is virtually a copy of the ancient marble, excepting only the right arm and support and the slight downward cast of head and eyes. Perhaps Powers hoped to obscure his debt through this bit of misdirection.</P>
<P>Whether viewed in a European or an American context, Powers was not atypical among mid-nineteenth-century sculptors. The art of sculpture was in a quandry, with Zola announcing, "Let our sculptors repeat this to themselves every morning "sculpture, as Greece understood it, has become a dead language for us." Part of the problem was subject matter: modern or relevant themes were widely called for; part was the stifling formality of Neo-classical style. Although in his day Powers's religious themes were considered relevant, he did not depart from the established mode. Among his contemporaries, it may be that only Antoine-Louis Barye and Jean Baptiste Carpeaux were successful in finding a modern style. For both it was a naturalism highly charged with movement and emotion. Having rejected that alternative after his bust of Jackson, Powers preferred to cater to conventional taste.</P>

"3875","Artist Biography","<P>Maurice Prendergast was born in St. Johns, Newfoundland, but with the failure of his father's subarctic trading post the family moved to Boston. There young Maurice was apprenticed to a commercial artist and at the outset was conditioned to the brightly colored, flat patterning effects that characterized his mature work. For many years thereafter loosely handled watercolor remained his favored medium and gave his work vibrant spontaneity.</P>
<P>A shy and retiring individual, he remained a bachelor throughout his life, closely attached to his artist brother Charles, who was also a successful frame maker. For three years Maurice studied in Paris at the Atelier Colarossi and the Académie Julian. During one of his early stays in Paris he met the Canadian painter James Morrice, who introduced him to English avant-garde artists Walter Sickert and Aubrey Beardsley, all ardent admirers of James McNeill Whistler. Prendergast's aesthetic course was set. A further acquaintance with Vuillard and Bonnard placed him firmly in the postimpressionist camp. He developed and continued to elaborate a highly personal style, with boldly contrasting, jewel-like colors, and flattened, patternlike forms rhythmically arranged on a canvas. Forms were radically simplified and presented in flat areas of bright, unmodulated color. His paintings have been aptly described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics. A trip to Venice in 1898 exposed him to the delightful genre scenes of Vittore Carpaccio and encouraged him toward even more complex and rhythmic arrangements. He also became one of the first Americans to espouse the work of Cézanne and to understand and utilize his expressive use of form and color.</P>
<P>In 1907, Prendergast was invited to exhibit with the Eight, colleagues of Robert Henri and exponents of the Ashcan school. Prendergast and the romantic symbolist Arthur B. Davies seem oddly mismatched to these urban realists, but all were united in an effort to stir the American art scene out of its conservative lethargy.</P>
<P>In 1913 he was invited to participate in the famed Armory Show, which was largely arranged by his friend Davies. Not surprisingly, Prendergast's brilliantly unorthodox offerings were decried as resembling "an explosion in a paint factory." On the same occasion Marcel Duchamp's <I>Nude Descending a Staircase</I> (1912) was similarly deplored as "an explosion in a shingle factory," suggesting either a failure of critical imagination or a case of collegial plagiarism. But of the Americans represented there, Prendergast's works were the most thoroughly modern and postimpressionist.</P>
<P>Who can now pass a playground teeming with brightly dressed children or wander through a public park where the varicolored garb of its occupants does not call to mind the stirring images Maurice Prendergast has left us? As Oscar Wilde once ventured, "Life imitates art far more than art imitates life."</P>

Raffael's works of the mid 1960s&mdash;surreal combinations of imagery cut from magazines&mdash;were thematically concerned with "pain, suffering, and cut-off things" and bear little resemblance to either the work of his Yale professors Josef Albers and James Brooks or to Raffael's more recent compositions. In the 1960s Raffael began painting streams and isolated flora and fauna in natural settings, working from photographs to capture momentary and spontaneous occurrences in nature. In these paintings Raffael synthesizes realism and abstraction; he crops external references to natural scale and distance, so that a single image often fills the picture plane. In his recent work, Raffael shows the entire sweep of a garden rather than close-up individual images and consciously organizes his subjects to produce dramatic effects of contrast and brilliance.</p><p>Virginia M.

In 1772 Ramage traveled to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in search of patrons, settling three years later in Boston where he continued his vocation with some degree of success. When John Singleton Copley, Boston's most prominent painter, left for England in 1774, the field opened for other artists. Ramage joined "the Loyal Irish Volunteers," a military regiment defending Boston on behalf of the British Crown. Ramage's loyalty to the king led him to New York City in 1777, which was then under British occupation. He traveled back and forth between New York and Halifax, troubled by debt, bigamy, and failing health due to alcoholism. In 1794, to escape further debts, Ramage fled to Montreal, where he died in 1802.</p><p><i>National Museum of American Art</i> (CD-ROM) (New York and Washington D.C.: MacMillan Digital in cooperation with the National Museum of American Art, 1996)</p>",""
"3930","Artist Biography","<P>Martín Ramírez came to the United States from Mexico as a young man. His physical frailty, as well as the shock caused by a new culture and language, led to his eventual mental breakdown. In 1930 he was placed in an institution, where he remained until his death in 1960.</P>
<P>Around 1948, Ramírez began to draw on an eclectic array of paper surfaces—brown wrapping paper, laundry lists, paper cups, old letters—which were glued together to form a unified drawing area. He made use of a variety of tools and techniques, including crayons, colored pencils, watercolors, chalk, ink, and collage.</P>
<P>Ramírez's motifs reflect his life in two distinct cultures. His highly patterned, intricate drawings present fantastic renditions of subjects such as Mexican soldiers, Madonnas, prairie dogs, cars, and trains. In terms of technique, what is most extraordinary in Ramírez's art is his use of line to create the many different kinds of space—niches, frames, stages—in which his protagonists are placed. Although flatness characterizes the overall effect of his technique, the numerous parallel lines in Ramírez's work bring about a sense of visual depth.</P>
<P>In <I>Soldado with American Flag,</I> [SAAM, 1986.65.194] the action takes place, as in many related Ramírez drawings, on what can be described as a stage. Directly below the soldier on horseback, who holds center stage, is another drawing in which two animals are portrayed inside a similarly constructed stage. Although Ramírez's central image has a wonderful and playful quality, the proximity of the two seemingly unrelated scenes lends the work an air of potent mystery.</P>

Ramírez spent the remainder of his life in California mental hospitals. After 1940, while institutionalized at the DeWitt State Hospital near Sacramento, he assembled his memories on pieces of scrap paper, pasted together with improvised adhesives, and drew his precise, dense, and repetitive marks and shapes with scavenged pencils, crayons, and markers.</P>

Born in New York City, Rand was educated at Pratt Institute, Parsons School of Design, and the Art Students League, where he worked with George Grosz. From 1936 to 1941 he served as the art editor of <i>Esquire</i> magazine, and he taught at the Advertising Guild, Pratt, Cooper Union, and Yale University, where he was a professor emeritus of graphic design. He has received awards from the American Institute of Graphic Arts and the Art Directors Club of New York and was given an honorary doctorate by the Philadelphia College of Art.</p><p>Rand designed the logos for a number of major commercial firms, including IBM, the American Broadcasting Company, and Westinghouse Corporation. His commitment to design education, combined with his writings and numerous visual innovations, constitutes a lasting legacy for American designers.</p><p>Rand's poster designs reflected his theoretical writings on this art form. In one important essay he emphasized the need for a poster to work as a cohesive facet of the environment for which it is intended, and he discussed at length the different consequences that this interdependence can have on all aspects of the design process. The theme of integration and harmony in design was a constant for Rand. Writing in 1970 on the process of effective graphic design, he stated:</p><blockquote><i>The designer does not, as a rule, begin with some preconceived idea. Rather the idea is &#133; the result of careful study and observation, and the design is the product of that idea. In order, therefore, to achieve an effective solution to the problem the designer must necessarily go through some sort of mental process. Consciously or not, he analyzes, interprets, formulates. He is aware of the scientific and technological developments in his own and kindred fields. He improvises, invents, or discovers new techniques and combinations. He coordinates and integrates his material so that he may restate his problem in terms of ideas, signs, symbols, pictures. He unifies, simplifies, and eliminates superfluities. He symbolizes&mdash;abstracts from his material by association and analogy. &#133; He draws upon instinct and intuition. He considers the spectator, his feelings and predilections.</i></blockquote><p>Therese Thau Heyman <i>Posters American Style</i> (New York and Washington, D.C.: Harry N.

"5477","Artist Biography","<p>"It's very important to keep your artistic level at the highest possible range of development and yet make your work convey a telling quality in terms of what we are as people." &mdash;Hale Woodruff, quoted in Albert Murray et al., <i>Hale Woodruff : 50 Years of His Art</i> (New York: The Studio Museum in Harlem, 1979), 76.</p><br /><p>Born in Cairo, Illinois, Woodruff grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. In the early 1920s, he studied at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he lived for a number of years. He later studied at Harvard University, the School of The Art Institute of Chicago, and the Acad&eacute;mie Moderne and Acad&eacute;mie Scandinave in Paris. He spent the summer of 1938 studying mural painting with Diego Rivera in Mexico, an experience that greatly affected Woodruff's evolving style until the early 1940s.</p><p>Woodruff's earliest public recognition occurred in 1923 when one of his paintings was accepted in the annual Indiana artists' exhibition. In 1928 he entered a painting in the Harmon Foundation show and won an award of one hundred dollars. He bought a one-way ticket to Paris with the prize money, and managed to eke out four years of study with an additional donation from a patron.</p><p>In 1931, Woodruff returned to the United States and began teaching art at Atlanta University. It was Woodruff who was responsible for that department's frequent designation as the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts" of the black South in later years. As he excelled as chairman of the art department at Atlanta University, his reputation also grew as one of the most talented African-American artists of the Depression era.</p><p>Woodruff's figurative style of the 1930s was bold and muscular. Southern lynchings of blacks stirred his conscience deeply, and inspired him to design a series of block prints that were as impressive as his oils and watercolors. His best-known and most widely acclaimed works at this time were the <i>Amistad</i> murals he painted between 1939 and 1940 in the Savery Library at Talladega College in Alabama. These murals were commissioned in celebration of the one-hundredth anniversary of the mutiny by African slaves aboard the slave ship <i>Amistad</i> in 1849, their subsequent trial in New Haven, Connecticut, and return to West Africa following acquittal.</p><p>The curvilinear rhythms of Woodruff's Mexican muralist-inspired works such as the <i>Amistad</i> murals were absent in his productions of the 1940s. His Georgian landscapes of the 1940s are simpler in concept and dominated by diagonal accents and bold contrasts in darks and lights. Whether in oil or watercolor, many of Woodruff's landscapes of the 1940s depict tarpaper shanties, community wells, and outhouses to the extent that he frequently referred to this group of landscapes as the <i>Outhouse School</i>. These subjects were handled accurately and sensitively but without sentimentality.</p><p>During the 1940s Woodruff also completed a series of watercolors and block prints dealing with black themes related to the state of Georgia. In the September 21, 1942, issue of <i>Time,</i> Woodruff stated, "We are interested in expressing the South as a field, as a territory, its peculiar run-down landscape, its social and economic problems&#151;the Negro people."</p><p>In 1946 Woodruff moved to New York where he taught in the art department at New York University from 1947 until his retirement in 1968. During the mid-1960s Woodruff and fellow artist RomareBearden were instrumental in starting the Spiral organization, a collaboration of African-American artists working in New York. Woodruff's New York works were greatly influenced by abstract expressionism and the painters of the New York School who were active duringthe late 1940s and 1950s. Among his associates were Adolf Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, and Jackson Pollock. Following a long and distinguished career that took him from Paris to New York via the Deep South, Woodruff died in New York in 1980.</p><p>Regenia A.

"3939","Artist Biography","<P>Son of a commerical photographer, Henry Ward Ranger attended Syracuse University between 1873 and 1875. He opened a studio in New York about 1884 and then traveled extensively abroad, making lengthy visits to museums in England and on the Continent. His travels included a trip with Horatio Walker to Holland, where he spent two or three years. Beginning in 1899, he began spending his sumers sketching in the vicinity of Old Lyme, Connecticut. He set up a country studio at Noank, Connecticut, where he spent six or seven months of the year, spending the late autumn and early winter in New York City, and mid-January to early spring in Puerto Rico or Jamaica. Around 1900, Ranger helped establish an artists' colony at Old Lyme and in 1901 was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design. He was made a full academician in 1906. Ranger's many honors and awards included a bronze medal at the International Exposition of 1900 in Paris and a silver medal at the American Art Society in 1907 in Philadelphia. According to the terms of his will, Ranger bequeathed his entire residuary estate to the National Academy of Design for the purchase of paintings by living American artists, such work to be distributed or accessioned by the National Collection of Fine Arts [now the Smithsonian American Art Museum].</P>
<P>A sound business man, congenial raconteur, and clever experimenter with pigments, Ranger deserves special credit for giving the original impetus to the "American Barbizon" colony in Old Lyme. His specialty was forest interiors in which one is led in quiet stages back into the woods or down a winding stream. He lavished great attention on the bark of large, partially lit trees, their autumn leaves rendered in thick dabs of paint over damp varnish. An assiduous student of Barbizon and nineteenth-century Dutch art during all of his formative years, Ranger maintained a deanship among American landscapists of his era. This did not produce a bevy of promising followers, however, although the stamp of his meditative approach to nature can be found in the landscapes of several of his contemporaries, including Elliott Daingerfield and Hugh Bolton Jones.</P>

Schooled at the Philips Academy from 1880 to 1884, he was a student and teaching assistant at the Boston Museum School, an institution then known for its conservatism. He studied briefly at the Art Students League in New York then journeyed to Paris for three years of study at the Académie Julian.</P>
<P>While in France, he worked with the colony of French and foreign artists at Etaples on the Normandy coast, painting peasant genre scenes of religious tone. Returning to New York he taught at the Art Students League and Cooper Union. After 1890 he seems to have been inundated with important mural commissions: the "White City" in Chicago, the Boston State House, the Library of Congress, and many private institutions. It was also at this time that his conversion to impressionist technique began to manifest itself. The Beaux Arts classical female nudes of his murals were now joined by easel paintings of loosely gowned maidens carefully posed in landscapes or sunlit gardens and rendered in vivid colors with slashing brushwork.</P>
<P>In 1897 he was inaugurated into the Ten American Painters, the youngest of that number, but affecting a dazzling palette that outshone the more somber tones of his colleagues. The decorative quality of his canvases prompted a major critic to dub him a "decorative Impressionist"; yet another called his work "sentimental" and "pretty," all of which must have improved his sales in some markets. As Richard Boyle astringently remarks, "sentiment pervaded all the art world at that time. It was popular and it sold."</P>
<P>A self-indulgent and vain man, social by nature and much given to gambling, in due course his expenses exceeded his income and he was impelled to retreat to Colorado Springs where he established an art academy and painted innumerable portraits to recoup his losses.

"4086","Artist Biography","<P>Theodore Robinson was born in Irasburg, Vermont, but at the age of three his family moved to Wisconsin. Robinson's earliest art study was done at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1869. Soon thereafter, he went to Paris where he continued his studies with conservative masters Carolus-Duran and Jean-Léon Gérôme. Broke and hungry he returned to New York, where he found friendship and employment with John La Farge. Financial considerations recurrently obliged him to teach, a chore he never enjoyed. This may have been because from childhood he suffered severe asthma attacks, which seriously depleted his energy and ultimately led to his premature death.</P>
<P>During these early years a persistent theme emerged in his work. He often painted realistically rendered rustic genre scenes of single female figures in landscapes somewhat in the earlier manner of Winslow Homer and Eastman Johnson.</P>
<P>In 1884, Robinson returned to France where he remained for eight years, moving soon to Giverny where he became a close neighbor and friend of Monet, frequently enjoying the hospitality and critiques of the aging master. There his painting acquired the attributes of the French impressionist school, the high color and flickering light, the broken brush stroke and repeated diagonal areas of mottled color, but never losing the form and structure of the American aesthetic.</P>
<P>His skills and his proximity to Monet propelled him to the center of the American coterie at Giverny and gave him the authority and influence to communicate impressionist attitudes and techniques to his compatriots.</P>

He worked with Weir and Twachtman at Cos Cob in Connecticut, painted the picturesque canals of New York State, and finally gravitated to a Giverny of his own in his home state of Vermont.

From 1891 to 1894 he continued his studies in London and Paris, influenced by the Swiss-French artist Eug&egrave;ne Grasset's style, which infused his posters with moral content. Rhead was also influenced by Walter Crane and William Morris, two English artists involved with the Aesthetic movement.</p><p>In the 1890s Rhead designed nearly one hundred posters. His first posters were done in England for <i>Cassell's Magazine</i> and the <i>Weekly Dispatch,</i> and also for Phitesi boots. In the United States he created posters for a variety of magazines, including <i>The Century, St. Nicholas, Harper's, The Bookman,</i> and <i>Scribner's.</i> He also produced large one- and two-sheet posters for the <i>New York Sun</i> and the <i>New York Journal,</i> and commercial posters for the printing firm Louis Prang and Company, as well as for products such as Lundborg perfumes, Pearline washing powders, and Packer's soap.</p><p>Rhead's posters were widely acclaimed; solo exhibitions of his work were presented in London in 1896 and in Paris at the Salon des Cent in 1897.

His first efforts, inspired by natural forms, were made from glass and intended to hang on a wall, but Rickey quickly substituted the simple, angular forms fashioned from metal that became his signature style.</p><p>The slender, carefully balanced, pointer-like forms of these new sculpures responded to the wind and rain. In time, Rickey broadened the size of his elements, forming pieces from rectangular planes that pivoted on a conical base.

"4086","Artist Biography","<p>Robinson was instrumental in bringing new styles of painting from the old world to help the new world look at its past.

This tidy trajectory was altered in 1887, however, when Robinson began to travel about the French countryside and discovered the artist colonies at Barbizon and Giverny. Although Robinson moved to Giverny in 1888 and became a disciple of Claude Monet, the leading French impressionist, he maintained his interest in the human form and his figural landscapes owe much to Barbizon-school painters such as Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Millet.</p>
<p>Robinson brought this hybrid style back to New York City in 1892. Subsequent artistic travels tools him to his native Vermont, as well as to Boston and to popular watering holes such as Greenwich and Cos Cob, Connecticut.

On his return to New York, however, Robus again painted, experimenting with the bright prismatic colors and fragmented space characteristic of Italian Futurism. In 1920 Robus gave up painting for sculpture, although his first solo show of three-dimensional work did not occur until 1949, when Robus was sixty-four. In his sculpture Robus explored simple themes—a woman washing her hair, a girl reading, a mother with her child.

"4134","Artist Biography","<p>Although Ralph Rosenborg has painted abstract work throughout his life, nature has served as his perennial motif.(1) He won a scholarship while still in high school to Saturday art classes at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. After classes ended, he later continued to study privately with his teacher there, Henriette Reiss, who provided not only exacting technical training, but broad-based instruction in music, literature, and art history. More significantly, Reiss had worked with Kandinsky earlier in her career and introduced her young prot&eacute;g&eacute; to the vast arena of vanguard European ideas. After four years, Rosenborg was ready to exhibit. He showed frequently during the 1930s&mdash;initially in group exhibitions at ACA Galleries and later in Mayor La Guardia's 1934 Mile of Art at Radio City. His first solo exhibition, at the Eighth Street Theater in 1935, was followed by shows at various galleries almost annually throughout the 1940s.</p><p>A highly personal artist, inclined toward interpreting nature rather than the geometric form pursued by many of his fellow members of the American Abstract Artists, Rosenborg wrote in 1955,</p><blockquote>"Painting will always remain a super-real world to me, devoid of all modern forms of blasphemy. It is a world in which the immensity of creation moves me to a personal form of prayer and contemplation. It is also a world in which its laws demand a personal integrity of purpose, a simple humbleness, and a sufficient set of experiences as the basic requirement for admission to it."(2)</blockquote><p>During the 1930s and 1940s, Rosenborg moved freely between expressionist watercolors evocative of the rhythms and colors of nature (such as the <i>Untitled</i> watercolor of about 1938) and more consciously structured oils, such as <i>The Far-away City,</i> in which deep-toned, dream-world landscapes take on the color and architecture of expressive stained glass. He paid little heed to modernist theories of surface and structure that fascinated many of his contemporaries. Later during the 1950s, Rosenborg's paintings increasingly reflected the energies, as well as the appearances, of the natural world. Tumultuous seascapes, serene landscapes, and brightly colored floral still lifes, were all executed with an attention to richly textured, heavily painted surfaces.</p><p>Although New York City has remained home for Rosenborg throughout his career, he has traveled widely. In 1966, an award from the National Council on the Arts and Humanities enabled him to tour Europe. He continually strives upward in his work, and frequently draws an arrow in a rectangular box on the back of his paintings. Originally a Mayan motif, the arrow, for Rosenborg, "signifies that I will strive to always go up, aesthetically, spiritually, and from all practical points of view. It's very important because I try to stay on earth, but actually, the painting is another world."(3)</p><br /><br /><p>1.

Around 1945, however, Roszak abandoned Constructivism because it reflected a view of the world he took to be falsely harmonious. Seeking to reintegrate content into his work, Roszak began welding and discovered that surface effects achieved by accident suggested a world of meaningful associations.

"4199","Artist Biography","<P>Albert P. Ryder was a descendant of Cape Cod families, and his paternal grandparents belonged to a strict Methodist sect whose women dressed Quaker fashion. In 1840 the family moved to New Bedford, then the greatest whaling port in the world, and it was there that Albert was born in 1847. In 1879 the family moved to New York, Ryder's home for the rest of his life.</P>
<P>He studied for a time at the National Academy of Design, and also under the portraitist and engraver, William Marshall. His first recorded exhibition at the National Academy was in 1873. In 1877 he went to London for a month and in 1887 and 1896 he crossed and recrossed the Atlantic on a ship captained by a friend of his.</P>
<P>The preceding information is a selection of the facts of Ryder's biography; [T]he facts do not illumine his gifts and his personality. As Barbara Novak observed, Ryder's entire oeuvre, religious or secular, might be seen as an act of devotion. Ryder painted two versions of the Easter morning encounter of Christ with the Magdalene, another version of the Way of the Cross, the extraordinary Jonah, and many small seascapes. The latter are the work of a visionary and a romantic, one who sees all of nature within the purview of the Almighty, as is also the case in his Jonah.</P>
<P>In studying Ryder's work, it is interesting to discover that the human figure is most fully realized in the paintings with religious subject matter; in the two paintings of Christ and the Magdalene, and the Joan of Arc, the figure is larger in scale, and rendered with more detail, and more psychic identity than is the case in his other works. In the filtered daylit or moonlit land- and seascapes (actually the terms land- and seascapes with their suggestion of horizontal extension in space do not seem appropriate for these glimpses of nature distilled by the hand and the spirit of Ryder), the human figures are embedded in nature, their posture and gestures hardly distinguishable from their setting.</P>
<P>Lloyd Goodrich says that Ryder is "one of the few authentic religious painters of his period" in whom religion was not mere conformity, but deep personal emotion. The life of Christ moved him to some of his most tender and impressive works."</P>
<P>Because of Ryder's method of working on his canvases over long periods of time, applying layers of pigment upon earlier coats which were not entirely dry, his paintings are in fragile condition. Many of them can only survive in entirely controlled and stable conditions.</P>

For two decades, he divided his time between teaching at the Cincinnati Art Academy, sketching in the Northwest, and summering at Taos, where he finally established a permanent residence in 1912. Sharp was a charter member of the Taos Society of Artists, with which he exhibitied for many years. His favorite subject was the Indian and his fast-disappearing lifestyle.

By 1867 the young Saint-Gaudens showed such promise that his father sent him to Paris to study with the academic sculptor Fran&ccedil;ois Jouffroy. From that date until the early 1880s, he moved back and forth between New York and Europe, supporting himself through portrait busts and cameos. During this period he also began to obtain commissions for public monuments.</p>
<p>In 1885, Saint Gaudens bought a farm in Cornish, New Hampshire, and settled permanently in the United States. His residence served as both home and studio, as well as one of the principal gathering places of the noted local art colony, which included the painters Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Abbott Handerson Thayer. During the summer months this select group of artists, musicians, and actors came to Cornish. seeking inspiration from the New Hampshire countryside and interaction with one another.

"4253","Artist Biography","<p>Sargent, born in Italy to American parents and educated in Germany and France, possessed a keen eye for regional social conventions. As the premier society portrait painter of his day, Sargent instinctively knew what pose, attire, and mood to suggest in London, New York, or Boston. His English subjects have an air of pomp and splendor, New Yorkers have a cosmopolitan appearance, and Boston subjects often look a bit more serious, as if ancestral responsibilities rested on their shoulders.</p><p>Sargent's understanding of old New England imagery may well have been learned over time; his father, the surgeon Fitz William Sargent, descended from a prominent Gloucester, Massachusetts, family. The Sargents relocated to Europe in 1854 and raised their children as peripatetic members of an international elite. John Singer attended schools in Florence and Dresden before entering the atelier of Carolus-Duran and the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts in 1874. Academic training equipped Sargent with narrative conventions that he adjusted for class and local color in his portraits, yet his lively brushwork was up-to-date, even forward-looking. This unique style secured several commissions for Sargent on his first visit to Boston in 1887. By 1890 his reputation was such that the trustees of the Boston Public Library selected the painter to decorate the interior of the institution's new McKim, Mead, and White building in Copley Square.</p><p>William H.

Subjects ranged from silent movie photographs and pictures of important historical events to reproductions taken from period children's books. In the corners of his canvases Sarsony often paints small images copied from cards found in cigarette packages and cereal boxes during the first half of this century. In doing so he follows in the steps of the nineteenth-century trompe l'oeil artists who depicted visiting cards that looked as though they were tucked under the edges of their paintings' frames. More recently Sarsony has portrayed figure and landscape subjects with an attention to light effects that gives his canvases an impressionistic air.</p><p>Virginia M.

"4269","Artist Biography","<p>"I have created nothing really beautiful, really lasting, but if I can inspire one of these youngsters to develop the talent I know they possess, then my monument will be in their work."&mdash;T. R. Poston, "Augusta Savage," <i>Metropolitan Magazine,</i> Jan. 1935, n.p.</p><br /><p> The career of Augusta Savage was fostered by the climate of the Harlem Renaissance. During the 1930s, she was well known in Harlem as a sculptor, art teacher, and community art program director. Born Augusta Christine Fells in Green Cove Springs, Florida, on February 29, 1892, she was the seventh of fourteen children of Cornelia and Edward Fells. Her father was a poor Methodist minister who strongly opposed his daughter's early interest in art. My father licked me four or five times a week," Savage once recalled, "and almost whipped all the art out of me."</p><p>In 1907 Savage married John T. Moore, and the following year her only child, Irene, was born. Moore died several years after the birth of their daughter. Around 1915 the widowed artist married James Savage, a carpenter whose surname she retained after their divorce during the early 1920s. In 1923, Savage married Robert L. Poston, her third and final husband, who was an associate of Marcus Garvey. Poston died in 1924.</p><p>Savage's father moved his family from Green Cove Springs to West Palm Beach, Florida, in 1915. Lack of encouragement from her family and the scarcity of local clay meant that Savage did not sculpt for almost  four years. In 1919 a local potter gave her some clay from which she modeled a group of figures that she entered in the West Palm Beach County Fair. The figures were awarded a special prize and a ribbon of honor. Encouraged by her success, Savage moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where she hoped to support herself by sculpting portrait busts of prominent blacks in the community. When that patronage did not materialize, Savage left her daughter in the care of her parents and moved to New York City.</p><p>Savage arrived in New York with $4.60, found a job as an apartment caretaker, and enrolled at the Cooper Union School of Art where she completed the four-year course in three years. During the mid-1920s when the Harlem Renaissance was at its peak, Savage lived and worked in a small studio apartment where she earned a reputation as a portrait sculptor, completing busts of prominent personalities such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey. Savage was one of the first artists who consistently dealt with black physiognomy. Her best-known work of the 1920s was <i>Gamin</i>, an informal bust portrait of her nephew, for which she was awarded a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship to study in Paris in 1929. There she studied briefly with Felix Benneteau at the Acad&eacute;mie de la Grand Chaumi&egrave;re. She had two works accepted for the Salon d'Automne and exhibited at the Grand Palais in Paris. In 1931 Savage won a second Rosenwald fellowship, which permitted her to remain in Paris for an additional year. She also received a Carnegie Foundation grant for eight months of travel in France, Belgium, and Germany. </p><p>Following her return to New York in 1932, Savage established the Savage Studio of Arts and Crafts and became an influential teacher in Harlem. In 1934 she became the first African-American member of the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. In 1937 Savage's career took a pivotal turn. She was appointed the first director of the Harlem Community Art Center and was commissioned by the New York World's Fair of 1939 to create a sculpture symbolizing the musical contributions of African Americans. Negro spirituals and hymns were the forms Savage decided to symbolize in <i>The Harp.</i> Inspired by the lyrics of James Weldon Johnson's poem <i>Lift Every Voice and Sing,</i> <i>The Harp</i> was Savage's largest work and her last major commission. She took a leave of absence from her position at the Harlem Community Art Center and spent almost two years completing the sixteen-foot sculpture. Cast in plaster and finished to resemble black basalt, <i>The Harp</i> was exhibited in the court of the Contemporary Arts building where it received much acclaim. The sculpture depicted a group of twelve stylized black singers in graduated heights that symbolized the strings of the harp. The sounding board was formed by the hand and arm of God, and a kneeling man holding music represented the foot pedal. No funds were available to cast <i>The Harp,</i> nor were there any facilities to store it. After the fair closed it was demolished as was all the art.</p><p>Upon returning to the Harlem Community Art Center, Savage discovered that her position had been assumed by someone else. This initiated a series of frustrations that virtually forced Savage to end her career. The Harlem Community Art Center closed during World War II when federal funds were cut off. In 1939 Savage made an attempt to reestablish an art center in Harlem with the opening of the Salon of Contemporary Negro Art. She was founder-director of the small gallery that was the first of its kind in Harlem. That venture closed shortly after its opening due to lack of money. During the spring of 1939, Savage held a small, one-woman show at the Argent Galleries in New York.</p><p>Depressed by the loss of her job and the collapse of both of her attempts to establish art centers, Savage retreated to the small town of Saugerties, New York, in the Catskill Mountains in 1945 and reestablished relations with her daughter and her daughter's family. Although her artistic production decreased, she found peace and seclusion in Saugerties. Savage visited New York occasionally, taught children in local summer camps, and produced a few portrait sculptures of tourists. During her years in Saugerties, Savage also explored her interest in writing children's stories, murder mysteries, and vignettes, although none were published. In 1962 Savage moved back to New York and lived with her daughter. She died in relative obscurity on March 26, 1962, following a long bout with cancer.</p><p>Savage effectively captured the essence of her subject's personality in this diminutive bust. Wearing a "be-bop" cap with its wide brim cocked jauntily to the side, the figure tilts his head in the same direction and looks past the observer with a slightly sullen expression of typical boyhood defiance. The sculpture was modeled in clay, cast in plaster, and painted to resemble the award-winning version. Savage's facility in handling the clay medium is clearly demonstrated in her sensitive modeling of the boy's broad features, deeply set eyes, and prominent ears. In addition, the open collar of his wrinkled shirt and crumpled cap contribute to the sculpture's informality and immediate appeal.</p><p>Regenia A.

"4287","Artist Biography","<p>"Though much of my work is generally classified as abstract, all of my work develops from natural forms. I have great respect for the forms of nature and an inherent need to express myself in relation to those forms. No matter how far my experimental design may take me &#133;  there remains always a core of objective reality which I have no desire to destroy or even to impair but only to investigate, analyze, develop."(1)</p><p>Louis Schanker was one of many members of the American Abstract Artists who chose to base his art in the objects, patterns, and rhythms of nature. Although never a student of Hans Hofmann, Schanker's ideas about art had many parallels with Hofmann's. Concern for the spatial dynamics of a painting's surface, and an insistence on some aspect of nature as a starting point for art, are two areas that mirror a shared philosophy between the two artists. Although much of Schanker's later work is completely abstract, during the 1930s and 1940s he frequently used direct, identifiable themes&mdash;motifs drawn from sports, his early years working for a circus, and even socially conscious subjects not normally employed by abstract artists.(2)</p><p>As a youth, Louis Schanker quit school and ran away to join the circus. He put in two years of "interesting but grueling hard labor."(3) After leaving the circus, he worked as a laborer in the wheatfields of Canada and the Dakotas, as a "gandy dancer" on the Erie Railroad, and as a stevedore on Great Lakes steamers. For almost a year Schanker cast his lot with hobos, riding freight trains throughout the country. In 1919, he put this itinerant life behind him and began attending night classes at Cooper Union. Subsequently, he studied at the Art Students League of New York and the Educational Alliance. Schanker spent 1931 and 1932 in Paris. He took classes at the  Acad&eacute;mie de la Grande Chaumi&egrave;re and worked on his own, doing "plein air" the work of Renoir, Degas, and Signac made a deep impression on the young artist. After he moved to Mallorca in 1933, Schanker began abstracting form to a greater degree and incorporating Cubist devices of uptilted planes and prismatic color in his work.</p><p>During the mid 1930s, Schanker began making prints and subsequently became a graphic arts supervisor for the WPA. He also completed murals for radio station WNYC, the Neponsit Beach Hospital in Long Island, and the Science and Health building at the 1939 New York World's Fair. During World War II, Schanker worked as a shipfitter and began teaching the technique of color woodblock printing at the New School for Social Research. In 1949, he became an assistant professor at Bard College, where he remained until his retirement.</p><p>Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Schanker exhibited frequently in group shows both in museums and in commercial galleries. He became especially well known for his innovations as a printmaker. Schanker belonged to The Ten, a group that exhibited together in protest against the hegemony of Americanscene painting in Whitney exhibitions and in support of artistic experimentation and an international (rather than nativist) outlook in art.(4)</p><p>Schanker imbued his prints, paintings, and sculpture with an animated expressionism that aims at a fundamental emotional structure. Sculptures such as <i>Owl,</i> carved in 1937, adroitly convey not only the bird's physical appearance, but the quality of mystery that has made it a symbol of wisdom and secrecy. <i>Three Men,</i> exhibited in the American Abstract Artists' first annual exhibition in 1937, exemplifies the expressive, angular animation for which Schanker's work was frequently praised in press reviews of the 1930s.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"I ran away from school to join the 'big top' and put in two years of interesting but grueling hard labor as a 'canvas-man,' 'animal ostler,' and 'property-man' for clowns, acrobats and other performers with one of the best known American circuses.

Between 1936 and 1942 he taught, first at the Leonardo da Vinci Art School, and later at the Contemporary School of Art in New York. During this time he also did privately commissioned murals.(2)</p><p>In 1943, Sennhauser began working for Hilla Rebay at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. At that time, he explained the impulse behind his new style as "rather universal, or subjective," terms that were consonant with Rebay's ideas on mysticism. He continued,</p><p>"&#133; Lines, planes, forms, colors, rhythmically moving &#133; intuitively conceived &#133; intuitively born of life eternal. Plastic integration of form and space of body and spirit&#133;.</p><p>Intensity &#133; Stillness &#133;</p><p>Harmony &#133; Contrast &#133;</p><p>The everlasting negative in all its positive manifestations, pure as immortality, free as the infinite &#133; The essence of all that is and is not &#133;"</p><p>In <i>Black Lines No. 13</i> (1944), <i>Organization No. 16</i> (1942), and other paintings from the late 1930s and 1940s, Sennhauser sought to express universal order. Although he described his working method as intuitive, "the flowing of &#133;  feeling through my body into my arm &#133; to my hand &#133; into my brush &#133;," he also consciously composed in terms of dualities of line, color, form, and space.(4) Sennhauser was not doctrinaire in promoting these ideas, however. He believed that all art, the socially conscious as well as the "esthetically directed," should seek truth and order and meet exacting standards of whatever grammar and syntax the artist chooses to use.(5)</p><p>Sennhauser, like Dwinell Grant and others who were closely associated with Rebay at the Guggenheim, became disaffected with Rebay's philosophical and personal inflexibility. He resigned in 1945. In the 1950s and 1960s, he worked as a restorer. During these years he became increasingly active in several artists' organizations, including the American Abstract Artists and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors. In 1961 he again exhibited figurative work, freely painted canvases with sensual surfaces that were dramatically opposed to the more formal geometries of his earlier work. Sennhauser's switch to figuration did not come overnight, however; in his watercolor and casein works from the early 1950s on, he often adopted a free Abstract Expressionism distinct from the structural approach of his canvases.</p><br /><br /><p>1. <i>New York Herald Tribune,</i> 26 April 1936 (review of an exhibition of Sennhauser's work at the Leonardo da Vinci Art school).</p><p>2.

"4372","Artist Biography","<p>According to Jon Serl, this painting began one afternoon with the drawing of a neighborhood boy who interrupted Serl's painting. Serl told the boy to retrieve a piece of scrap board and work on his own creation, instructing him to "put the head all the way at the top and put the feet at the bottom." When he saw the initial drawing, Serl was inspired to work on it himself, to "make it live." The result is a composition characteristic of Serl's art that interweaves daily realities with his profoundly subjective view of contemporary life.</p><p>As a child, Serl performed in his family's traveling vaudeville show, and this experience provided an essential element of his mature painting style. When Serl began painting inearnest after World War II, his earliest compositions were landscapes. By the mid to late 1950s, Serl's vision had turned toward expressionist figurative studies that continue to command his attention. His portrayals of human interaction are usually stagelike, achieving their mysterious qualities by a masterful use of color.

"5302","Artist Biography","<P>Julian Alden Weir was born at West Point, New York, the son of Robert Weir, the longtime drawing master at the military academy. The elder Weir taught his son and also had been Whistler's first teacher. Alden later studied at the National Academy of Design in New York and in Paris worked at the École des Beaux-Arts with Jean-Léon Gérôme. From the outset he was set on a course of academic conservatism. While in France he was close to the plein air genre painter Jules Bastien-Lepage, who was often regarded as being beyond the prevailing academicism. Weir's initial response to the emergent impressionism was one of disbelief. "I never in my life saw more horrible things. They do not observe drawing nor form but give you an impression of what they call nature. It was worse than the Chamber of Horrors," he wrote.</P>
<P>Gradually, however, he was brought around, mainly through the influence of his friends John Twachtman and Theodore Robinson. Together they explored the techniques of Japanese prints, carefully assessing the aesthetic function of flat patterning, cropping asymmetry, oblique angles, muted tonalities, and high horizons.</P>
<P>Weir had purchased a large farm property in Branchville, Connecticut, and like Twachtman employed its topographical resources for his landscape studies.</P>
<P>In 1897, with Twachtman and Hassam, he formed the group of Ten American Painters and exhibited with them for two decades. He was also a close friend and admirer of that solitary genius Albert Pinkham Ryder, caring for him in his illness and attending to the details of his hospitalization and funeral.</P>
<P>As Weir slowly moved toward impressionism, he painted attractive if somewhat idealized pictures of the factories at nearby Willimantic and, perhaps most dramatically, the Red Bridge that spanned the Connecticut River. As art historian William Gerdts writes, "the high horizon, the assertive geometry of the composition and especially its dominant diagonals suggest its derivation from Japanese art!" In the last decade of his life, although he had been an avid proponent of modernism, his own work came full circle, returning to a stodgy academicism.</P>

Shahn's first major success came with the 1932 exhibition of his series <i>The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti.</i> Shahn once said that he paints two things, "what I love and what I abhor," and during the Depression years his scenes of children playing in concrete urban parks, and of miners and construction workers engaged in their trades, reflect his admiration for the working American and his abhorrence of injustice and oppression.

"4404","Artist Biography","<p>Charles Shaw began painting when he was in his late thirties.  A 1914 graduate of Yale, Shaw completed a year of architectural studies at Columbia University. In 1927, he began to take a serious interest in art and enrolled in Thomas Hart Benton's class at the Art Students League in New York. He also studied privately with George Luks who became his friend. Prior to this, Shaw enjoyed a successful career as a free-lance writer for The New Yorker, Smart Set, and Vanity Fair, chronicling the life of the affluent theater and caf&eacute; society of the 1920s. Shaw, born into a wealthy New York family, had entr&eacute;e and moved easily in the social circles of New York, Paris, and London in the late 1920s and 1930s.(1)</p><p>In addition to his witty and insightful articles, Shaw was a poet, novelist, and journalist. He published several books&mdash;a novel entitled <i>Heart in a Hurricane</i> and a collection of interviews with New York literary figures called <i>The Low Down.</i>(2) Once he had dedicated himself to non-traditional painting, Shaw's deft ability with pen made him a potent defender of abstract art.</p><p>After initial study with Benton and Luks, Shaw continued his artistic education in Paris by visiting museums and galleries. During the first week of a 1932 trip, he surveyed thirteen galleries, and was particularly impressed by the work of C&eacute;zanne and Picasso.(3) From 1930 to 1932, Shaw's paintings evolved from a style imitative of Cubism to one inspired by it though simplified and more purely geometric. In 1933, having returned to the United States, he began a series of works entitled the <i>Plastic Polygon</i> that occupied his attention until the end of the decade. The best known of these are drawn from the architectural forms of the New York City skyline and are often painted on shaped canvases that echo the architectural silhouette of the skyscrapers. Within this structural framework, overlapping rectangular forms allude to different heights and widths of adjacent buildings. In them, illusory space is compressed; only the tonal variations of the colors and the subtle manipulation of rectangles evoke a sense of three dimensionality.</p><p>The <i>Plastic Polygon</i> series, which Shaw described in an article for <i>Plastique,</i> earned him a respectable reputation among the individuals and galleries interested in American abstract art in the 1930s. He had a solo exhibition at Valentine Gallery in 1934, and in 1935, Albert Gallatin organized a show of Shaw's work at the Gallery of Living Art.</p><p>Shaw traveled to Paris again during the summer of 1935 with Gallatin and George L. K. Morris. There he met John Ferren and Jean H&eacute;lion. The following year Gallatin organized an exhibition, called <i>American Concretionists,</i> at the Reinhardt Gallery that included Shaw, Ferren, and Morris, as well as Alexander Calder and Charles Biederman.</p><p>Shaw became a founding member of the American Abstract Artists and exhibited in the first annual exhibition. His article, "A Word to the Objector," was included in the group's first publication. In it, Shaw chastised "anti-abstractionists" for their prejudice against abstract art. He also, in the article, expressed his profound belief that abstract painting was "an appeal to one's &#133; 'aesthetic emotion' alone &#133;  [rather than] to those vastly more familiar emotions, which are a mixture of sentimentality, prettiness, anecdote, and melodrama."(4)</p><p>During the 1940s Shaw strayed from the strict geometrical format of the polygon paintings. <i>Untitled</i> of 1941 is awhimsical and delicate painting of tents in a nocturnal landscape reminiscent of Paul Klee's work. Here and in <i>Untitled Abstraction</i> of 1943, Shaw softened both his palette and his edges in favor oflyrical balance and subtly modulated color.</p><p>Throughout his career as an artist, Shaw made montages of antique playing and tarot cards, game boards, and other paraphernalia associated with games. Reflecting his study of the history of cards and games, Shaw mounted cards on old textiles in symmetrical and asymmetrical designs. Although most are undated, the composition of the earlier montages is randomly ordered and spontaneous, while the more highly structured later works relate to the geometric formulation of the plastic polygon paintings.(5)</p><p>These montages were personal works for Shaw. He never exhibited them, although they were installed from floor to ceiling throughout his apartment. Indeed, the enigmatic quality of the cards provides an intriguing twist in the study of Shaw's art and contributes additional clues to his multifaceted character.</p><br /><br /><p>1. George L. K. Morris described Shaw as "well over six feet tall and sturdily built. His appearance was elegant, with a neatly trimmed mustache and a slightly florid countenance. He might have passed as one of the elusive characters in a British spy movie. &#133;" See "Charles Shaw," <i>Century Yearbook</i> (New York: Century Association, 1975).</p><p>2.

His accomplishments as a poet won Shaw the Michael Strange Poetry Award in 1954.</p><p>3. During his first trip to Europe, in 1929, Shaw spent only a month in Paris.

"5499","Artist Biography","<P>Raised in Defiance, Ohio, Alexander H. Wyant worked during his teens as a sign painter in nearby Port Washington. In 1857 he was impressed with some paintings by George Inness at an exhibition in Cincinnati and soon left for New York to meet Inness. After returning to Cincinnati, Wyant secured the support of Nicholas Longworth and went to study in New York in 1860. After an interlude of two years in Cincinnati, he moved back to New York City in 1863. He exhibited for the first time at the National Academy of Design in 1864 and was elected an associate there in 1868 and an academician in 1869. Wyant went abroad in 1865, studying for a few months with the Norwegian painter Hans Frederik Gude at Karlsruhe, and making brief stops in England and Ireland before settling again in New York. From 1867 he exhibited his watercolors almost annually and was instrumental in the founding of the American Water Color Society in 1878.</P>
<P>A partial stroke while on a government expedition to Arizona and New Mexico in 1873 led to paralysis of his right arm. Between 1864 and 1880 he worked in his studio in New York City, teaching himself to paint with his left hand. After his marriage in 1880, he began to spend most of his time in Keene Valley, New York. He moved in 1889 to Arkville, New York (in the Catskills), occasionally revisiting his New York City studio.</P>
<P>Wyant's signature style was developed slowly and not without several false starts along the way. Special contributions came from his initial contact with Inness shortly after that artist's sojourn in France; the startling revelations disclosed to Wyant by his study of Constable and Rousseau; and his stroke in 1873, which accelerated the artist's movement away from the sort of detailed examination of natural facts that one finds, for example, in his well-known <I>Mohawk Valley</I> [the Metropolitan Museum of Art]. After 1866 Wyant gradually shifted toward a more fluid handling of paint, with increasing reliance on a palette emphasizing shades of white, gray, and the earth colors. In his later years Wyant's solitary, introspective mood came to blend more closely than ever with his landscapes, especially those from the Arkville area, where a kindred spirit, J. F. Murphy, also worked.</P>

Sloan worked for this newspaper from 1895 to 1903. In 1904 he moved to New York, and in 1906 he exhibited at the American Watercolor Society. As a founding member of the group of artists known as The Eight, he exhibited with them at the Macbeth Galleries in 1908. In 1910, along with other artists in the circle of Robert Henri, Sloan participated in the Exhibition of Independent Artists. In 1912 he became a member of the editorial board of the radical journal <I>The Masses</I> and also began teaching art privately. In 1916 he joined the faculty of the Art Students League.

"4477","Artist Biography","<p>During the period of social and political turmoil that followed the Russian Revolution, Esphyr Slobodkina fled with her family to Vladivostok, and then to Harbin, Manchuria. In 1928, she immigrated to New York and the following year entered the National Academy of Design. Although unenthusiastic about the curriculum, Slobodkina's visa required that she attend school, and she remained at the Academy until 1933. It was fortunate that she did, because through his sister, also a student, she met Ilya Bolotowsky, whom she married in 1933.</p><p>Slobodkina remembers her first long conversation with Bolotowsky as a lecture on composition, in which Bolotowsky talked of organization, mass, form, color, space&mdash;heady new ideas despite her several years of academic training. Through Bolotowsky, Slobodkina met Byron Browne, Gertrude and Balcomb Greene, Giorgio Cavallon, and others whose conversations roamed from discussions of the cost of canvas to the "latest capers in Picasso's procession of quickly changing styles."(1)</p><p>Slobodkina still considered herself very much a student when she married Bolotowsky, but, by signing her name to several of his early paintings, he wangled invitations for both of them to go to Yaddo, an artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, New York. Still wavering between the Impressionist theories she had learned earlier, and Bolotowsky's modernist ideas (he had not yet ventured into pure abstraction), she painted expressionist still-life and interior scenes during the several months they spent in Saratoga Springs. Her first Cubist-inspired painting&mdash;a fractured image of the sink in her bathroom&mdash;was created in 1934. Without rejecting more expressionist landscape and still-life paintings, she began in the winter of 1936&ndash;37 to concentrate seriously on abstraction. Once begun, Slobodkina moved quickly through her Cubist experiments toward a concern with planes and flattened pictorial space.</p><p>Financial pressures in the 1930s made it difficult for Slobodkina to concentrate on painting. Her parents had come to New York, but the family's economic situation was precarious. During the early 1930s she and her mother opened a dressmaking business, designing and creating fine clothing and millinery. Among other short-lived jobs, Slobodkina worked for several textile printing firms, each of  which folded. Although her parents still needed her help, her own situation dramatically changed when Bolotowsky joined the Public Works of Art Project and later the WPA: "It gave us bread, it gave us time, and above all, it gave us peace of mind."(2) When Slobodkina and Bolotowsky separated in 1935, Slobodkina went on relief, and then joined the WPA herself.</p><p>She became very active in the Artists' Union, and when members were asked to make posters for a fundraising event, Slobodkina presented collages. More at ease with scissors and paper than with drawing, Slobodkina's collages honed her developing abstract style. She did several constructions early in her career, three-dimensional assemblages of wood, wire, and other found objects, and experimented with found-object sculpture. In her paintings of the late 1930s, forms are often flattened and overlaid in spatial configurations associated with collage. She also began experimenting with gesso panels, finding the evenly sanded surfaces especially suited to the linear clarity of her forms.</p><p>Slobodkina joined the American Abstract Artists early in the organization's history. She had not attended the preliminary meetings at Ibram Lassaw's studio in 1936, but once a member, served the organization in various capacities for several decades. During the early 1940s, with Alice Trumbull Mason, she helped organize an ambitious program of cultural evenings that combined lectures and parties. In her role as hospitality chairman, she introduced socially prominent New Yorkers to the organization.</p><p>A change in the direction of her career came in 1937, when Slobodkina first met Margaret Wise Brown, a noted author of children's books. Hoping to find illustration work, she wrote and illustrated a children's story to present as an introductory "portfolio". Still not confident of her ability as a draftsman, Slobodkina cut little figures out of paper and collaged them to make her designs. Brown was charmed by their directness and simplicity and asked Slobodkina to illustrate Brown's book <i>The Little Fireman,</i> published the following year. This was the first of many children's tales that Slobodkina was to illustrate, and soon she began writing her own stories as well. <i>Caps for Sale,</i> her best-known book, has become a classic.</p><p>By the mid 1940s, Slobodkina had matured as an artist&mdash;Albert Gallatin owned two of her paintings, and she was invited to exhibit in the influential "Eight By Eight" exhibition of American abstract art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1945.3 With technical problems well in hand, she developed compositions such as <i>Crossroad #2</i> and <i>Spring #3,</i> in which she juxtaposed planar shapes to create subtly modulated movement. Often abstractions from objects, the paintings of these years are well-harmonized arrangements of color and form. Her exuberance and energy continued to surface in collages&mdash;<i>As Indicated,</i> for example&mdash;and she expressed her irrepressible wit in found object sculpture, and jewelry made of old typewriter parts. Inrecognition of her own accomplishment and creative potential, Slobodkina was invited back to Yaddo in 1957, and the following year she went twice to the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire. Since then she has exhibited frequently, and her little books continue to delight children the world over.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

The result was surfaces that acquired a texture and topography reminiscent of the landscapes she was depicting.

"4592","Artist Biography","<p>In the mid-1950s, ceramicist Rudolf Staffel, a teacher at Philadelphia's Tyler School of Art, was commissioned by a local patron to create a dinner service in porcelain. Like most American ceramicists of the time, Staffel did not regard porcelain as a material suitable for craft productions. White, translucent, and vitrified, porcelain was firmly associated with decorative arts and dinnerware manufacturers, not studio potters. Unfamiliar with recipes for kaolin clay and necessary firing temperatures, Staffel's porcelain plates proved unsuccessful, but he marveled at their ability to transmit light. Soon, he began to experiment with porcelaneous clay bodies to achieve even stronger effects of translucency.</p>
<p>Initially, Rudi Staffel stained his porcelain vessels with colors, but as his experimentations with the physical properties of porcelain and its inherent translucency progressed, he began to produce bowls and cylindrical pots that were pure white. However, he later occasionally introduced a blue tone into his clay bodies. Either wheel thrown or hand-built, these open forms allow ambient light to enter the interior of the vessel and shine softly through thinner sections of the unglazed walls. "Translucency absorbs light, holds light, and lets some go through," he states; "it stores light, while it transmits light. ... inner light." Because of their luminous effects, the artist calls these containers <i>Light Gatherers,</i> and since their interiors emit light directly through the walls, the viewer is simultaneously made aware of the inside as well as the outside of the pot.</p>
<p>Rudi Staffel's "light gatherers" have walls of varying thickness, since, he declares: "To be aware of translucency, you must have opaqueness. ... It's the contrast in the body of the pot, between thick and thin, that gives the sensation of translucency." Thrown vessels are pinched by fingers or scored with sharp instruments, while the more sculptural, hand-built forms are often layered with pieces of clay to vary the transmittal of light.</p>
<p>The optical effects of dark and light contrasts on a pot's surface are analogous to the results of the "push-pull" theory of abstract painting promoted by Staffel's one-time teacher, Hans Hofmann. By manipulating the thickness of his pigments, the latter created a dynamic visual tension between transparent areas of thinly colored stash that suggest depth, and thickly painted zones that, by contrast, emphasize the flatness of the picture plane. Like Hofmann's abstract paintings, Staffel's porcelain "light gatherers" embody notions of push-pull. The thin, luminous sections of porcelain evoke deep space, while the opaque areas of thicker clay stress the material nature of the pot's wall. However, these essentially pictorial concerns are always balanced by Staffel's innate abilities to create vessels that, in their graceful plasticity, are satisfyingly sculptural.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

The deliberately artificial nature of his work, emphasizing the flatness of the picture plane, further emphasized by metallic or fluorescent paints, won considerable attention. By the mid-1960s Stella was in the forefront of the Post-Painterly Abstraction group of artists who were reacting to the dominance of Abstract Expressionism.</p><p>During the late sixties and seventies, his vocabulary of shapes broadened to include zigzags, stripes, and arcs, often executed in garish hues. But by this time Stella's idea of a painting's structure had become ever more complex, and he began to experiment with assemblages of dynamic forms that extended several feet into space from the picture s background support. The artist's ambitious vision embraced a variety of media, from honeycomb steel to luminous plastic, to achieve his goal of freeing painting from the wall. Through this ongoing process of formal and technical experimentation, Stella's influence on his peers and younger artists has been profound.</p><p>Stella has also been a prolific printmaker since his first efforts in graphic art in 1967. These works have been closely related to his paintings, but over the years have grown increasingly complex. Reflecting on the changes in his printmaking, Stella has stated: "At the time, I was into the business of painting with printmaking techniques &#133; to use the printing ink as though it were a painting medium. &#133;  Now I'm using the process for something else. I try to make prints about printing."</p><p><i>National Museum of American Art</i> (CD-ROM) (New York and Washington D.C.: MacMillan Digital in cooperation with the National Museum of American Art, 1996)</p>",""

"4742","Artist Biography","<P>Working in France after 1891, Henry Ossawa Tanner achieved an international reputation largely through his religious paintings. Their deep spirituality reflects Tanner's upbringing as a minister's son as well as the influence of his visits to the Holy Land after 1897.</P>
<P>Head bent, gaze intent, hands clasped, <I>The Savior</I> [SAAM, 1983.95.191] is absorbed in contemplation or prayer. The circumstances of the solitary vigil are ambiguous. Has Tanner chosen a particular moment on the mountain, in the Garden of Gethsemane, or just before the Crucifixion? Or has he treated instead the very act of prayer as a means to salvation? Whatever the context, Tanner presents Christ as a man of humble origin rather than as a transcendent, godlike figure. His carefully delineated features and bowed posture create the psychological penetration of a portrait.</P>
<P>Based on one of his sketches of Near Eastern men, Tanner's study conveys Christ's timeless humanity, while its sensitivity and strong modeling reveal the artist's admiration for the portraits of his teacher, Thomas Eakins.</P>
<P>An expressive realism characterizes <I>The Savior,</I> reflecting Tanner's mounting interest in the work of French Symbolist painters at the turn of the century. The painting's mottled browns and beiges derive from his training in the French academic tradition; influenced by the Impressionists' light and color, he later abandoned his subdued palette.</P>
<P>Although Tanner remained active until 1936, he avoided avant-garde developments after 1900. Nor did he align his expressive style with the efforts of African-American artists during the Harlem Renaissance; believing that he could not fulfill his artistic potential while fighting discrimination in America, he moved to Paris in 1891. Nonetheless, Tanner's universal subject matter and the international dimensions of his career provided inspiration for future African-American artists.</P>

<P>The most distinguished African-American artist of the nineteenth century, Henry Ossawa Tanner was also the first artist of his race to achieve international acclaim. Tanner was born on June 21, 1859, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Benjamin Tucker and Sarah Miller Tanner. Tanner's father was a college-educated teacher and minister who later became a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopalian Church. Sarah Tanner was a former slave whose mother had sent her north to Pittsburgh through the Underground Railroad. Tanner's family moved frequently during his early years when his father was assigned to various churches and schools. In 1864 Tanner's family settled in Philadelphia where his early artistic interests were developed. At age thirteen, Tanner decided to become an artist when he saw a painter at work during a walk in Fairmount Park near his home. Throughout his teens, Tanner painted and drew constantly in his spare time and tried to look at art as much as possible in Philadelphia art galleries. He also studied briefly with two of the city's minor painters.</P>
<P>Eager to discourage his son's interest in art, Bishop Tanner apprenticed him to a friend to learn the milling business. For Tanner, a frail young man whose health was never strong throughout his life, the work in the flour mill proved too strenuous and he became seriously ill. His parents encouraged his painting during his recuperation, and Tanner lived at home during the next few years except for several trips to the Adirondack Mountains and Florida for his health. In 1880, when Tanner was twenty-one, he enrolled in the prestigious Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. There he studied with a group of master professors including Thomas Eakins. It was Eakins who exerted the greatest influence on Tanner's early style. Tanner left the Pennsylvania Academy prior to graduating to pursue the idea of combining business with art. In 1888 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and established a modest photography gallery where he attempted to earn a semiartistic living by selling drawings, making photographs, and teaching art classes at Clark College. In spite of his combined efforts, Tanner's Atlanta venture barely profited enough to provide living expenses.</P>
<P>In Atlanta, Tanner met Bishop and Mrs. Joseph Crane Hartzell, who became his primary white patrons over the next several years. In the summer of 1888 Tanner sold his small gallery and moved to Highlands, North Carolina, in the Blue Ridge Mountains where he hoped to study and earn a living by his photography. He also felt that the mountains would be good for his delicate health. While there, Tanner may have made many sketches and photographs of the region and its African-American residents, some of which were later used as subjects in his most important early paintings.</P>
<P>In the fall of 1888, Tanner returned to Atlanta and taught drawing for two years at Clark College. After discussing his ambitions to travel abroad with Bishop and Mrs. Hartzell, they arranged an exhibition of Tanner's works in Cincinnati in the fall of 1890. When no paintings were sold, the Hartzells bought the entire collection. This endowment allowed Tanner to sail for Rome in January 1891. After brief stays in Liverpool and London, Tanner arrived in Paris. He was so impressed by this center of art and artists that he abandoned his plans to study in Rome.</P>
<P>In Paris, Tanner enrolled in the Académie Julian where the painters Jean Paul Laurens and Jean Joseph Benjamin-Constant were among his teachers. It was not long before he painted two of his most important works depicting African-American subjects, <I>The Banjo Lesson</I> of 1893 and <I>The Thankful Poor</I> of 1894. During the summers of 1892 and 1893, Tanner left Paris and lived in isolated rural areas in Brittany. His best-known paintings from that period are <I>The Bagpipe Lesson</I> of 1894 and <I>The Young Sabot Maker</I> of 1895. Both depict French peasants, and Tanner assimilated the inhabitants of his rural French environment into his works as he had done previously in the mountains of Highlands, North Carolina.</P>
<P>In 1895, Tanner painted <I>Daniel in the Lion's Den,</I> which won an honorable mention in the Paris Salon the same year. Two years later he completed <I>Resurrection of Lazarus,</I> which so impressed Rodman Wanamaker, a Philadelphia merchant in Paris, that he decided to finance the first of Tanner's several trips to the Holy Land. Before leaving, Tanner sent his <I>Resurrection of Lazarus</I> to the Paris Salon where it was awarded a third class medal and was purchased by the French government for exhibition at the Luxembourg Gallery and eventually entered the collection of the Louvre.</P>
<P>Spurred by his newly found acclaim, Tanner visited Philadelphia for several months in 1893. The visit, however, convinced him that he could not fight racial prejudice. Tanner returned to Paris and focused on painting religious subjects and landscapes. In 1899 Tanner married Jessie Olssen, a white opera singer from San Francisco, whom he had met in Paris. The couple's only child, Jesse Ossawa, was born in New York in 1903. Their marriage may have influenced Tanner's decision to settle permanently in France, where the family divided its time between Paris and a farm near Étaples in Normandy.</P>
<P>During the final decades of Tanner's career he enjoyed consistent acclaim. In 1900, his 1895 painting, <I>Daniel in the Lion's Den,</I> was awarded a silver medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris; the following year it received a silver medal at the Pan American exhibition in Buffalo.</P>
<P>In 1908 his first one-man exhibition of religious paintings in the United States was held at the American Art Galleries in New York. Two years later, Tanner was elected a member of the National Academy of Design. In 1923 he was made an honorary chevalier of the Order of the Legion of Honor, France's highest honor, and in 1927 he became a full academician of the National Academy of Design, the first African American to receive that honor. In his later years, Tanner was a symbol of hope and inspiration for African-American leaders and young black artists, many of whom visited him in Paris. On May 25, 1937, Tanner died at his home in Paris.</P>

"4744","Artist Biography","<p>Edmund Tarbell's remarkable New Hampshire summer home is emblematic of the painter and his art. Just as the artist's paintings draw upon traditional styles and motifs to construct an image of genteel New England, Tarbell's house blended the old and the new to create a rarefied atmosphere of history and domesticity. On canvas, Tarbell repeatedly depicted modern life in terms of the past, arranging his female subjects in quiet interiors surrounded by icons of New England's glorious past, such as gate-leg tables, Chippendale chairs, and incense jars. Tarbell's sitters read, knit, and drink tea as if in a historical vacuum. At home, in the fashionable summer colony of New Castle on the Piscataqua River near Portsmouth, Tarbell recreated the same atmosphere. Starting with a modest nineteenth-century farmhouse, he tripled its size and used architectural fragments from earlier buildings to provide the new house and garden with historical ambience. Tarbell's arrival in New Castle marked his ascension to the very highest circles of New England society. Of old Yankee stock himself, he could trace his lineage back to 1638. This pedigree served the artist in his rise from a country boyhood in West Groton, Massachusetts, to school in Boston and Paris, and finally to his position as the leading arbiter of taste for genteel New England. Considered the dean of Boston school painters (dubbed "Tarbellites" in 1897 by the critic Sadakichi Hartmann), Tarbell taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts from 1889 until 1912, imparting his vision of a graceful past to a generation of Bostonians.</p><p>William H.

"4766","Artist Biography","<P><B>Abbott Thayer: The Nature of Art</B><BR>Abbott Handerson Thayer, is recognized today for his ethereal angels, portraits of women and children, landscapes, and delicate flower paintings. A New Englander who expressed the spiritual in much of his work, he was known as a "soul painter." In his own time, his work was praised by critics even as it was popular with the public and sought after by collectors.</P>
<P><B>Thayer's World</B><BR>Thayer was born into a distinguished Boston family. In the 1880s and 1890s he was a leader in the New York art world. While he carried on a lively trade in portraits, he also began to paint allegorical figures, which had gained popularity among collectors with a taste for subjects from classical antiquity and the European Renaissance.</P>
<P>In 1891, his first wife Kate Bloede Thayer died; her loss changed Thayer's art and his outlook on life in virtually every respect. Her family, intellectually and artistically distinguished German émigrés, had introduced Thayer to the romantic world of literature, music, and philosophy. The spiritual and idealist aspects of German philosophy, and its American counterpart in New England, transcendentalism, provided consolation. This idealism also prompted him to paint extraordinary figures that seemed to embody the perfection of beauty.</P>
<P>In 1901, Thayer left New York and settled in Dublin, New Hampshire, joining a colony of artists, writers, scientists, and cultural figures living at the foot of Mount Monadnock. Rejecting the commercialism and the hectic pace of urban life, he built a family compound within the Dublin colony. He married his long-time friend, Emma Beach, and with his three children, they lived and worked in a complex of studios, barns, houses, gardens, and unheated sleeping huts. During this time he turned to more contemplative and even enigmatic subjects: portraits of close friends and family, meditative views of Mount Monadnock, and a series of angels.</P>
<P><B>An Amateur Naturalist</B><BR>Thayer was an amateur naturalist and a passionate bird-lover. He believed that his professional training in color, value, and design, combined with observation of nature, gave him the tools to understand how animals disguise themselves from predators. He devoted considerable time and energy to defining, promoting, and defending his ideas on the subject.</P>
<P>Thayer developed a love for the mountain that overlooked his studio. Through his efforts to protect the forests on the slopes of Mount Monadnock he became a staunch conservationist. To support that work, he founded the Thayer Fund which, through the National Audubon Society, paid for wardens to protect bird sanctuaries up and down the east coast.</P>

"4766","Artist Biography","<p>Thayer's unusual Dublin, New Hampshire, house speaks volumes about the painter. Built in 1888 on land provided by Mary Amory Greene, a direct descendant of the colonial portraitist John Singleton Copley, the two-story building sported several screened-in porches and was surrounded by a number of sleeping huts&mdash;small lean-to structures that broke down the harriers of traditional Victorian domestic space and encouraged a rustic, almost wild atmosphere. The unruly house and unusual artist were not without their contradictions. To the right of the front door, mounted on a bracket, stood a copy of Daniel Chester French's famous bust of Ralph Waldo Emerson&mdash;a symbol of the intellectual rigor expected of family and guests. Thayer was the patriarch of an extended family of blood relations, servants, and models who became year-round residents of Dublin in 1901. His career had begun much earlier, first as an animal painter and then as a student at the National Academy of Design in New York and the &Eacute;cole des Beaux Arts in Paris. At the latter, he studied under Jean Léon G&eacute;r&ocirc;me.

"4778","Artist Biography","<P>During the 1960s Alma Thomas emerged as an exuberant colorist, abstracting shapes and patterns from the trees and flowers around her. Her new palette and technique—considerably lighter and looser than in her earlier representational works and dark abstractions—reflected her long study of color theory and the watercolor medium.</P>
<P><I>Red Sunset, Old Pond Concerto</I> [SAAM, 1977.48.5] emphasizes the intensity of a sunset as it overtakes a landscape, penetrating layers of greenery to strike darkening water. Broken rows of color pats, a hallmark of her mature style, alternate with emphatic vertical bands. Their irregular intervals create a visual rhythm akin to music, while dappled reds, greens, and blue-blacks orchestrate subtle nuances and dramatic contrasts. Thomas frequently talked about "watching the leaves and flowers tossing in the wind as though they were singing and dancing." She also liked to imagine seeing natural forms from a plane. Her lyrical interpretation of a pond at sunset suggests a blending of these two perspectives.</P>
<P>As a black woman artist, Thomas encountered many barriers; she did not, however, turn to racial or feminist issues in her art, believing rather that the creative spirit is independent of race or gender. In Washington, D.C., where she lived and worked after 1921, Thomas became identified with Morris Louis, Gene Davis, and other Color Field painters active in the area since the 1950s. Like them, she explored the power of color and form in luminous, contemplative paintings.</P>

"4778","Artist Biography","<P>"Man's highest aspirations come from nature. A world without color would seem dead. Color is life. Light is the mother of color. Light reveals to us the spirit and living soul of the world through colors."—Press Release, Columbus Museum of Arts and Sciences, 1982, for an exhibition entitled <I>A Life in Art: Alma Thomas 1891–1978, </I>Vertical File, Library</I>, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</P>
<P>Alma Thomas began to paint seriously in 1960, when she retired from her thirty-eight year career as an art teacher in the public schools of Washington, D.C. In the years that followed she would come to be regarded as a major painter of the Washington Color Field School.</P>
<P>Born on September 22, 1891, in Columbus, Georgia, Thomas was the eldest of four daughters. Her father worked in a church and her mother was a seamstress and homemaker. Thomas's family was well respected in Columbus, and she and her sisters grew up in comfortable surroundings. The family lived in a large Victorian house high on a hill overlooking the town where Thomas spent her childhood observing the beauty and color of nature. In 1907, when Thomas was fifteen years old, her father moved the family to Washington, D.C. She enrolled in Howard University, and in 1924 became the first graduate of its newly formed art department. Thomas's teacher and mentor, James V. Herring, granted her use of his private art library, from which she gained a thorough background in art history. A decade later, she earned a Master of Arts degree in education from Columbia University.</P>
<P>During the 1950s Thomas attended art classes at American University in Washington. She studied painting under Joe Summerford, Robert Gates, and Jacob Kainen, and developed an interest in color and abstract art. Throughout her teaching career she painted and exhibited academic still lifes and realistic paintings in group shows of African-American artists. Although her paintings were competent, they were never singled out for individual recognition.</P>
<P>Suffering from the pain of arthritis at the time of her retirement, she considered giving up painting. When Howard University offered to mount a retrospective of her work in 1966, however, she wanted to produce something new. From the window of her house she enjoyed watching the ever-changing patterns that light created on her trees and flower garden. So inspired, her new paintings passed through an expressionist period, followed by an abstract one, to finally a nonobjective phase. Many of Thomas's late-career paintings were watercolors in which bold splashes of color and large areas of white paper combine to create remarkably fresh effects, often accented with brush strokes of India ink.</P>
<P>Although Thomas progressed to painting in acrylics on large canvases, she continued to produce many watercolors that were studies for her paintings. Thomas's personalized mature style consisted of broad, mosaic-like patches of vibrant color applied in concentric circles or vertical stripes. Color was the basis of her painting, undeniably reflecting her life-long study of color theory as well as the influence of luminous, elegant abstract works by Washington-based Color Field painters such as Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, and Gene Davis.</P>
<P>Thomas was in her eighth decade of life when she produced her most important works. Earliest to win acclaim was her series of <I>Earth</I> paintings—pure color abstractions of concentric circles that often suggest target paintings and stripes. Done in the late 1960s, these works bear references to rows and borders of flowers inspired by Washington's famed azaleas and cherry blossoms. The titles of her paintings often reflect this influence. In these canvases, brilliant shades of green, pale and deep blue, violet, deep red, light red, orange, and yellow are offset by white areas of untouched raw canvas, suggesting jewel-like Byzantine mosaics.</P>
<P>Man's landing on the moon in 1969 exerted a profound influence on Thomas, and provided the theme for her second major group of paintings. In 1969 she began the <I>Space</I> or <I>Snoopy</I> series so named because "Snoopy" was a term astronauts used to describe a space vehicle used on the moon's surface. Like the <I>Earth</I> series these paintings also evoke mood through color, yet several allude to more than a color reference. In <I>Snoopy Sees a Sunrise</I> of 1970, she placed a circular form within the mosaic patch of colors and accented it with curved bands of light colors. <I>Blast Off</I> depicts an elongated triangular arrangement of dark blue patches rising dramatically and evocatively against a background of pale pinks and oranges. The majority of Thomas's <I>Space</I> paintings are large sparkling works with implied movement achieved through floating patterns of broken colors against a white background.</P>
<P>In her last paintings, Thomas employed her characteristic short bars of color and impasto technique. The tones, however, became more subdued, and the formerly vertical and horizontal accents of Thomas's brush strokes became more diverse in movement, and included diagonals, diamond shapes, and asymmetrical surface patterns. During the artist's final years, the crippling effects of arthritis prevented her from painting as often as she wanted.</P>
<P>Alma Thomas never married, and lived in the same house her father bought in downtown Washington in 1907. The final years of her life brought awards and recognition. In 1972 she was honored with one-woman exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art and at the Corcoran Gallery of Art; that same year one of her paintings was selected for the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Before her death in 1978, Thomas had achieved national recognition as a major woman artist devoted to abstract painting.</P>

"4784","Artist Biography","<P>Bob Thompson's short, but dynamic, career began in the late 1950s and ended in his premature death less than a decade later. Like other artists of his generation in New York, Thompson developed a vital new figurative style in reaction to the dominance of abstract art, yet adapted its spontaneity, scale, and expressive use of color.</P>
<P><I>The Spinning, Spinning, Turning, Directing</I> [SAAM, 1980.137.104] is a drama of bold exaggerations. Its principals are fantastic creatures whose silhouettes and unnatural colors distort their human, animal, or phantom origins. Sweeping curves, sharp zigzags, and steep diagonals rhythmically link the figures as they stand, sit, fall, or fly in their arbitrary space. A single tree in an arched opening focuses the scene, suggesting a cave that shelters its strange inhabitants from a brightly lit landscape.</P>
<P>Thompson was inspired by the play of good and evil, which creates both order and chaos in the relationships of man, animals, and nature. In his vision, nude female figures express nature's sensuality, while birds symbolize power and freedom as well as his preoccupation with the ultimate flight of death. Thompson revered the Old Masters, including Piero della Francesca, Masaccio, and Poussin, and used their works as points of departure. In <I>The Spinning, Spinning, Turning, Directing,</I> he reinterpreted images from three of Goya's Los Caprichos: <I>Tale Bearers, Hobgoblins,</I> and<I>Rise and Fall.</I> Whether sensual, spiritual, or tortured, Thompson's paintings are metaphors of both the rational and irrational forces of nature.</P>

The Monsters are present now on my canvas as in my dreams. …"<BR>—Gylbert Coker, <I>The World of Bob Thompson,</I> (New York: The Studio Museum in Harlem, 1979), 21–22.</P>
<P>Between 1958 and 1966, Bob Thompson was a talented, bohemian artist as well as one whose success in the New York art world was nothing short of phenomenal. Tragically, his life was cut short by his dissipated habits but more importantly, Bob Thompson produced an innovative body of metaphoric paintings at a time when both "classical" art historical sources and figurative styles were scorned.</P>
<P>Thompson's rather unremarkable early years were spent in Louisville, Kentucky, where he was born on June 26, 1937. Thompson's mother was a school teacher who instilled in her children the value of education.</P>
<P>When Thompson was thirteen his father was killed in an automobile accident. Young Robert became deeply depressed, and his mother sent him to Boston to live with his older sister and her husband. Thompson's mother wanted her son to become a doctor, and Thompson enrolled in a pre-med program at Boston University in 1955. He quickly, however, became bored with the program and his depression continued. Robert Holmes, his brother-in-law, remembered Thompson's childhood love of art and encouraged him to develop his talents as a means of alleviating his grief. Thompson returned home and in September 1956 enrolled as an art student at the University of Louisville. Soon he became involved with an intellectual art circle that held regular meetings and discussions.</P>
<P>During Thompson's junior year at the University of Louisville, one of his teachers, Mary N. Spencer, suggested that he would benefit from a summer in Provincetown, Massachusetts. There were two important art schools in the old fishing village of Provincetown—the Seong Moy Art School and an older, more established institution under the direction of Hans Hofmann, the innovative abstract expressionist painter. One of Hofmann's students at that time was the young artist Jan Müller, who departed from Hofmann's aesthetic principles of nonobjective painting in favor of afigurative style.</P>
<P>Provincetown was an exciting environment for Thompson, and he wasespecially attracted to Müller's figural paintings and the works of Red Grooms, from Nashville, Tennessee. Grooms was also involved in performances that were later called "Happenings" and represented a new aesthetic concept. Thompson was an active participant in many of Grooms' productions.</P>
<P>During the fall of 1958 Thompson returned to the University of Louisville and developed a keen interest in Italian Renaissance painting. He began copying works by Masaccio, Fra Angelico, and Piero della Francesca to develop his own visual vocabulary. He would later reinvent these images in his own personalized manner. Following his invigorating experiences in Provincetown, Thompson realized that his environment in Louisville could never fulfill his artistic needs. In the middle of the fall semester of his senior year Thompson moved to New York.</P>
<P>Upon his arrival in New York, Thompson discovered that his Provincetown cohorts, Christopher Lane, Red Grooms, and Jay Milder, had opened the City Gallery. Thompson moved in with Milder, joined the City Gallery, and began experimenting with the scientific perspective techniques of the Italian Renaissance. These experiments were subsequently transformed into contemporary reinterpretations of biblical themes.</P>
<P>Thompson rose quickly among the ranks of New York artists. His first one-man exhibition was held at the Delancey Street Museum, a space created by his friend Red Grooms. Next was a two-man exhibition with Jay Milder at the influential Zabriskie Gallery. In December 1960 Thompson married Carol Penda, whom he had met in Provincetown, and he was seen frequently at openings, night clubs, and other social gatherings.</P>
<P>In 1961 Thompson and his wife traveled to Europe and settled in Glacière, France, with the help of a Walter Gutman Foundation grant. He was awarded a John Hay Whitney grant in 1962 to continue his European work. In 1963 Thompson moved to Ibiza, Spain, and returned to New York late that year with a large body of new paintings. An old friend, Lester Johnson, arranged a meeting between Thompson and galleryowner Martha Jackson that resulted in a one-man exhibition and invitation to join the stable of artists shown by Jackson's gallery.</P>
<P>Representation by the influential Martha Jackson Gallery assured Thompson's recognition in the art world. His paintings began appearing in exhibitions around the country, and critics proclaimed the genius of the new, young, African-American master of Renaissance themes with a contemporary focus. Thompson's paintings were large, figurative, bright, raw, and unorthodox in their use of color, with birds and other winged creatures appearing as ubiquitous symbols. Some of Thompson's paintings were autobiographical, and many reflect his longstanding interest in music.</P>
<P>By 1964, when he was only twenty-eight years old, Thompson had experienced unprecedented success for an African-American artist. He painted incessantly and lived extravagantly. He longed to return to Europe, specifically to Rome, to study Renaissance art. With proceeds from his exhibition at the Martha Jackson Gallery, Thompson financed a trip to Rome in November 1965. In March 1966, Thompson underwent emergency gall bladder surgery in Rome. His doctors suggested a long period of recuperation but Thompson resumed his hectic lifestyle almost immediately. On May 30, 1966, less than a month before his twenty-ninth birthday, he died in Rome of lung complications. During a remarkably short career Thompson produced more than one thousand paintings as testimony to his unfaltering albeit meteoric commitment to his art.</P>

Tovish's early work reflects his experiments with figurative naturalism, which he often used to express themes of victimization. In 1949 his ideas became explicit in a series of figures that captured the horror he felt as a soldier exposed to Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II. Throughout his work Tovish seeks to unify form and content, placing heads or fragments of heads within spaces that function variously as refuges, prisons, or symbols of technological or societal entrapment. In the early 1950s, Tovish moved to Boston where he has taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and at Boston University. He spent 1965 as artist-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome.</p><p>Virginia M.

"4852","Artist Biography","<P>From 1939 to 1942, Bill Traylor recorded the life around him with uncanny artistry. A former slave and field hand, Traylor came to work in Montgomery when he was eighty-four, but circumstances soon left him penniless. In 1939, Traylor began to draw on discarded laundry cardboard, aided by a measuring stick, while he sat in front of the local pool hall observing Montgomery's Monroe Street market.</P>
<P>Forceful, enigmatic, and fanciful, his images depict a former life as well as the new characters in his daily environment. In many cases, an implicit intimacy between people and animals characterizes their pictorial relationship, reminiscent of Traylor's years in the fields.</P>
<P>Traylor sold some of his drawings on the street, attracting customers by hanging the drawings behind his working space. Most of his works, however, were saved by Charles Shannon, a young painter who had encouraged Traylor in his earliest efforts. In 1940, Shannon arranged a one-man show of Traylor's work at New South, a local contemporary art center. After an exhibition inNew York in 1941, Traylor's remarkable drawings were not seen again until a show in 1979 at R. H. Oosterom Gallery, also in NewYork.</P>

"4852","Artist Biography","<P>". . . it jes' come to me." —Bill Traylor, quoted in Allen Rankin, "He Lost 10,000 Years," <I>Collier's,</I> 22 June 1946, n.p.</P>
<P>When Bill Traylor was born in 1854 on the plantation of George Traylor near Benton, Alabama, the Emancipation Proclamation was still almost a decade away. He recalled little about his childhood during slavery, and he remained on the Traylor plantation until 1938, when he was eighty-four years old.</P>
<P>Traylor worked as a sharecropper for descendants of George Traylor for over eight decades, and during that period he raised some twenty children during his marriage. In 1938, after the death of Traylor's wife, he moved to Montgomery where he was employed briefly in a shoe factory until rheumatism and old age forced him to retire. Traylor's final years in Montgomery were almost entirely lacking in physical comforts. He had no fixed address, slept in the back room of a funeral parlor, and spent his days seated on downtown Montgomery's Monroe Street, where he was known by almost everyone.</P>
<P>In 1939, when he was eighty-five, Traylor's artistic impulses erupted suddenly and unexpectedly. More remarkable is the degree to which his style emerged fully developed and the even quality of his enormous output. Employing only pencils, a straight-edge, and a lap-sized drawing board, Traylor often began his works by applying a simple geometric form to any material at hand—paper, cardboard, or shirt cardboard. With crayons he then colored his simple geometric shapes, which became the basis of animals, human figures, and architectural structures. Animals are prominent among Traylor's forms, and include large red-tongued dogs, spotted cats, green goats, yellow birds, purple rabbits, and opossums. Other scenes depict dancers, drinkers, men driving mules, and women milking cows. Whether featuring single or multiple pictorial elements, Traylor's compositions reflect the experiences of his childhood and adult life.</P>
<P>Shortly after Traylor began drawing, his works were noticed by a young Montgomery artist, Charles Shannon, who immediately recognized the elderly man's talents. The two men developed a friendship; Shannon began to collect his drawings and provided him with simple materials. Traylor was extremely prolific and drew constantly, almost obsessively, as if to compensate for his late beginning.</P>
<P>Traylor's artistic activities were interrupted in 1942 when he moved north to live with some of his children during World War II. He lived for a while in Detroit, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., and, while he may have drawn during that period, no surviving works are known. In 1946 Traylor returned to Montgomery, but his desire and ability to draw had abated. About a year later Traylor became ill. He lived briefly with one of his daughters in Montgomery. He died in a nursing home in 1947.</P>
<P>Traylor's drawings reveal the memories and experiences of a man who enjoyed life's vigor and its humor in the face of hardship. Although Traylor had little awareness of himself as an artist, his drawings were exhibited twice during his lifetime. In 1940 they were shown at New South, an art center in Montgomery, and the following year at the Fieldston School in New York. It was not until almost forty years later that Traylor's works were exhibited publicly again at the Oosterom Gallery in New York.</P>
<P>Concerning the impact and mere survival of Traylor's drawings, the critic Allen Rankin wrote in 1946, "Will it live, this bizarre stuff which is primitive and Thurberish at the same time? Will it blow down the gutters of a little town when Bill is gone? Or will it have some little part of the permanence enjoyed by the rock-immortalized cave pictures which it resembles?" Rankin could not have imagined how prophetic his questions were, nor could he have foreseen the immortality of Traylor's drawings.</P>

In 1793 he settled in Philadelphia to make watercolor miniatures on ivory of Gilbert Stuart's portraits.

He exhibited several miniatures at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1811 and 1812.</p><p>Though his miniatures varied widely in both conception and technique, Trott won high praise for his likenesses.

Trumbull enjoyed great success as a portraitist during his four-year residence in New York, counting among his patrons the municipal government as well as the city's most prominent Federalist families. Economic conditions, specifically a trade embargo against Britain, "threatened the entire destruction &#133; of the prosperity of those friends from whom I derived my subsistence," Trumbull observed.

"4868","Artist Biography","<P>Dwight W. Tryon, as a youth, seemingly without formal training, painted landscapes in the vicinity of his native Hartford, Connecticut. He sold all his works at auction to finance a trip to Paris, where he studied with the renowned Barbizon landscapists Charles Daubigny and Henri Harpignies. Other influences on Tryon's work derived from Corot and Whistler. From the outset he was committed to the Barbizon mode.</P>
<P>Just before the Civil War, William Morris Hunt had introduced the Barbizon style to an enthusiastic Boston audience. The gritty realities of postwar urban living had imposed a need for a quieter, more poetic view of nature than the giantism of Church and Bierstadt. In the 1880s and 1890s, Americans responded warmly to these serene and muted depictions of a natural environment, which was slipping away. During the 1890s, Tryon's painting progressed from the massy forms and somber harmonies of his earlier Barbizon style toward the lighter, more poetic monochromatic palette of tonalism, seen in the work currently on display.</P>
<P>These pleasing bucolic works fulfilled an urgent need and brought Tryon a success and affluence that eluded many of his contemporaries. Like Dewing and Thayer he luxuriated in the generous patronage of Charles Lang Freer, and many of his works hang in the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 1893 he was commissioned to decorate the walls of Freer's Detroit mansion with a series of murals depicting the changing seasons.</P>
<P>For almost forty years Tryon enjoyed the security of a professorship at Smith College, in Northampton, Massachusetts, and at the end of his career bestowed an art museum on the college. In 1925 he died at his home in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts, not far from the entrance to Cape Cod.</P>

"4901","Artist Biography","<p>John Twachtman, the son of German immigrants, was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and had his first art training at the Ohio Mechanics Institute. In 1871 he enrolled in the McMicken School of Design where he studied with Frank Duveneck, who had just returned from several years of work in Munich. At Duveneck's urging Twachtman journeyed to Munich and enrolled in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. There he readily acquired skills in modeling forms, dark tonality, and bravura brushwork. Armed with these skills he set out for Venice, seeking to apply them to the city's ambient light and air, but with mixed results.</p><p>In 1883 he traveled to Paris to study at the Acad&eacute;mie Julian and suffered a violent reaction against his brownish Munich training. Deeply impressed by the painting of Whistler and the impressionists, and encouraged by Theodore Robinson and Childe Hassam, he moved toward a lighter palette and a more abstract simplification of forms. During his years in France he produced the most popular and profitable work of his career. Prompted perhaps by Whistler's delicate and evocative Venetian pastels, Twachtman now reduced detail and with broad, flat planes of thinly washed grays and green produced magnificently simple and suggestive canvases such as <i>Arques-la-Bataille</i> (1885), now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Japanese influence beautifully proclaimed itself.</p><p>In 1887, Twachtman returned to America and settled in an old farmhouse surrounded by seventeen acres at Cos Cob, Connecticut. Nearby, his closest colleague and most intimate friend, J. Alden Weir, had just previously settled down. Though Twachtman enjoyed several warm friendships in the artistic community he was essentially a "loner," a moody man given to fits of depression and most at ease communing with nature. "To be isolated is a fine thing and we are then nearer to nature," he wrote. His friends called him a true Thoreauvian.</p><p>At his new home Twachtman found or fabricated natural forms, which he painted repeatedly and in all seasons. He preferred to paint close-ups, "bits" as he called them, rather than broad panoramic views. With high or no horizons these were often painted on square canvases, which stabilized the image by minimizing dynamic movement in any direction. Within these parameters his strong sense of design and feel for abstraction gave solid structure to his work. His brushwork now became more impressionist and better attuned to the atmospheric effect he desired.</p><p>He became most skilled at depicting winter scenes, studies in whiteness, more tonalist than impressionist. He loved the winter and "that feeling of quiet and all nature is hushed to silence." Modern realism, he complained, "consists too much of representation of things." On canvas, he reduced winter to its essentials enabling him to evoke the poetic, mystical mood of nature.</p><p>The appeal of these works proved elusive to the public and the paintings did not sell, and Twachtman became increasingly depressed and discouraged. Domestic difficulties had prompted a separation from his wife and children. In 1900 he was induced to venture his efforts in another direction. Gloucester, Massachusetts, offered a new and different subject to his brush. On the picturesque waterfront of New England's premier fishing town his work moved away from the dissolution of form seen in his Cos Cob paintings toward a much more objective rendering of concrete subject matter. The sinuous contours of brooks and snowdrifts were replaced by the geometric forms of docks and vessels. Angles replaced curves and structure became more explicit and central.</p><p>Sadly the rejuvenation proved brief. In August 1902 a ruptured appendix prematurely ended his life. His place among the Ten American Painters, which he had only recently joined, was assumed by William Merritt Chase.</p><p>Emery Battis Artist Biographies for the exhibition <i>American Impressionism: Treasures from the Smithsonian American Art Museum</i> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2000)</p>",""

"5138","Artist Biography","<P>Born in New York City, Elihu Vedder, a descendant of Dutch forebears who had settled in this land before 1657, had his early education in New York City and Long Island. He started drawing in his youth, selling his first painting at the age of nineteen. Apparently his education was sound for though Vedder never went to college, his knowledge of humanistic studies was wide; all his life he had writers, intellectuals, poets, and artists as his friends. His mother encouraged him in his wish to be an artist and early in 1851 he began lessons with a drawing master, later entering the studio of an artist in Shelburne, New York. In 1856 Vedder embarked for Europe, and later in Florence studied with a copyist and teacher, Bonaiuti, who revered antiquity and taught Vedder draftsmanship.</P>
<P>Vedder returned to the States a number of times, but for the rest of his life his home was Rome, where he was at the center of the comings and goings of artists and poets of many countries who came for the city itself as well as for each other's company.</P>
<P>Vedder's mother was a Universalist, holding with serene conviction that there was no judgment and no place of eternal punishment. Nonetheless, in later years Vedder remarked that "in those early days no Christian home was complete without a Hell." Regina Soria remarked that his whole life was a struggle between faith and doubt.

"5138","Artist Biography","<P>The career of Elihu Vedder, who was born in New York City in 1836 and died in Rome, Italy, in 1923, spanned some sixty-five years. He began to paint when Courbet was a name to enflame the young and raise the hackles of critics, and died when Cubism had already become academic. His work related to neither. Although he was quite aware of the various art currents of his time, he was far too concerned with his own perceptions, dreams, and inventions to stay long with any particular vogue. Living most of his life in Italy, Vedder was in many ways a truly expatriate artist; he realized early that art itself provided a homeland and to it he was a loyal citizen. For him, Italy was the closest approximation of that land to be found on earth.</P>
<P>Vedder has been remembered for several different accomplishments but rarely as a unified artistic personality. His extraordinary illustrations to accompany Omar Khayyám's <I>Rubáiyát</I>, published in 1884, are an early and persuasive lesson in the compelling, evocative powers of a decorative style. His disarmingly simple, richly colored glimpses of the Italian landscape, however, celebrate the pleasures of direct perception. His work seems to be rooted firmly in two opposing traditions, each revolutionary in its way in the nineteenth century. Yet probably the most revolutionary aspect of Vedder was his refusal to take sides, to admit that the perceptual and visionary were at odds with each other.</P>

Encouraged that her son would have a future as an artist, von Wicht's mother sent him to the advanced private school of the Grand Duke of Hesse, where the professors encouraged students to draw plants and flowers to learn about organic growth, shape and proportion.

Von Wicht subsequently studied printing methods at the Royal School for Fine and Applied Arts in Berlin, but said he skipped class frequently to visit exhibitions of the newest painting&mdash;van Gogh, C&eacute;zanne, Munch, Gauguin, Kandinsky, and Franz Marc.</p><p>Wounded and partially paralyzed in the trenches during World War I, von Wicht spent several years recovering, doing book design and illustration work, and looking at art. It was during this recuperation that he discovered Mondrian and Malevich. In 1923, with inflation devastating the German economy, he immigrated to the United States. In New York, his early training served him well. He worked for two years with a lithography company, then joined a firm making stained glass and mosaics. He learned to use symbols rather than naturalistic motifs, and explored both geometry and dense color in abstract paintings such as the <i>Untitled</i> gouache of about 1938, and in murals for radio station WNYC and the New York World's Fair.</p><p>Von Wicht had his first solo show, of mural designs, at the Architect's Building in 1936. It was followed, in 1939, by an exhibition of his paintings at Theodor A. Kohn Gallery. The show at Kohn was well received by the New York press, and the following year he exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art. This exposure cemented von Wicht's reputation as an abstract painter. Throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, he exhibited frequently in solo and group exhibitions in New York and around the country. He was invited to join the American Abstract Artists and the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors.</p><p>During World War II, von Wicht served as captain of a supply barge ferrying food to army transport ships in New York harbor; after the war he continued to command a supply scow. Harbor themes began to appear in his abstractions, and during the 1950s his sensuously colored geometric abstractions gave way to loose,  expressionistic forms. In 1954 von Wicht received the first of twelve annual residencies at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire. The spacious studio and contact with other artists at the MacDowell Colony had an important impact on his work. In his exhibition at Passedoit Gallery that year, he exhibited paintings with nautical motifs in which the Cubist device of interlocking and overlapping planes was paramount. But von Wicht also began relating his work to music created by the composers he had met at MacDowell. Although his work was well received from the time of his first exhibition, critics attributed the expanded sense of space, brilliant color, and vigorous handling of paint surfaces in his new work to the experience of living away from the city. By the time he died, in 1970, von Wicht had received international acclaim.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"5179","Artist Biography","<p>Charmion von Wiegand began making abstract art only after meeting and becoming close friends with Piet Mondrian in the spring of 1941. Von Wiegand had been painting casually since about 1926, but after undergoing psychoanalysis, she realized that art remained as compelling in her adult years as it had been in childhood. But only after she met Mondrian, stopped painting the landscapes she found increasingly troublesome, and spent a year and a half reading and thinking about his Neo-plastic ideas, did she  finally come to grips with developing her mature artistic approach.</p><p>Long before her encounter with Mondrian, von Wiegand was immersed in the New York art world as a writer and art critic. She grew up in Arizona, but her strongest childhood memories were of San Francisco, where her family moved when she was twelve. Wandering around Chinatown nurtured what would become a life-long interest in Oriental culture. As a teenager, she lived for three years in Berlin, then after a year at Barnard College, she transferred to Columbia University in New York to study journalism, theater, and art history. Too "anarchistic" to take the required curriculum, von Wiegand did not complete her bachelor's degree, but she continued through extension courses to study theater, aiming to be a playwright. Shortly thereafter she began to paint. In 1929 she took a trip to Moscow, and while there obtained a job as a correspondent for the Universal Service of the Hearst Press.(1) On her return to the United States in 1932, she married Joseph Freeman, a founder of <i>The New Masses</i> and later an editor of the </i>Partisan Review.</i> Von Wiegand, herself, continued to write. She served as an editor of the Artists' Union publication <i>Art Front,</i> and wrote perceptive, often impassioned articles on art and exhibitions for <i>The New Masses,</i> <i>Art Front,</i> and other periodicals. She counted among her friends at this time Carl Holty, Raphael Soyer, Frederick Kiesler, Joseph Stella, Max Weber, John Graham, and other progressive and vanguard artists.</p><p>She decided to do an interview with Mondrian about six months after his arrival in this country. Carl Holty had arranged theintroduction. Von Wiegand and Mondrian quickly became friends, and von Wiegand assisted the elderly Dutch painter with revisions and translations of his writings. Although she had known Mondrian's works from the Gallatin Collection, she initially regarded them as overly mathematical. Only after meeting Mondrian did she become fascinated with the spiritual aspects of Neo-plasticism. Abandoning her landscape painting, von Wiegand immersed herself in Mondrian's ideas and read publications by Kandinsky and the Russian Constructivists. At Holty's urging, she became an associate member of the American Abstract Artists in 1941, but only began to exhibit with the group in 1948.</p><p>Although von Wiegand's paintings from the mid and late 1940s show evidence of her close study of Mondrian's work, she did not adopt the stringent grid format nor limited palette he preferred. She was fortunate to have watched Mondrian work on both <i>Broadway Boogie Woogie</i> and <i>Victory Boogie Woogie,</i> paintings in which he put aside his characteristic orthogonal black structure in favor of an architecture of color. Von Wiegand's paintings are spatially denser and more lyrically conceived, with diagonals, pointedarches, and curves enlivening her patterns of color. About 1946 she began making collages, whose stylistic kinship lay withKurt Schwitters, rather than Cubism or Neo-plasticism. In <i>Transfer toCathay</i> and others she combined strips of colored paper with pieces of matchbooks, subway and bus tickets, snippets of menus, and handwritten notes, harnessing the energies of the outside world within a loose, almost playful architecture.</p><p>During the 1950s von Wiegand moved away from Neo-plasticism. In 1968, she said, "I am not a disciple of it today. &#133; I still believe in the principles. But the expression that I am making now is different and is motivated in a different way and therefore must have a different basis."(2) The different basis of which she spoke came from her renewed interest in Eastern philosophy. Tibetan art and ideas, in particular, became central to her work; "its combinations of figurative and abstract symbolic elements in a hieratic, geometric formal structure" served as a foundation for her artistic and philosophical ideals.(3)</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"5185","Artist Biography","<p>Vaclav Vytlacil was among the earliest and most influential advocates of Hans Hoffman's teachings in the United States. Vytlacil, who first met Hofmann in Munich in 1923, had already completed his art studies and had been teaching art for five years. Vytlacil immediately grasped the significance of Hofmann's ideas. "I quickly realized," he later recalled, "that this is what I had been searching for."(1)</p><p>As a child, Vytlacil had taken art classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1913, he received a scholarship to the Art Students League in New York, where he worked with John C. Johansen, an able portraitist whose expressive style resembled that of John Singer Sargent and Anders Zorn. On completion of his studies in 1916, he accepted a teaching position at the Minneapolis School of Art. Vytlacil saved enough money to go to Europe in 1921. He hoped to study C&eacute;anne's paintings and the work of Old Masters. He spent a month in Paris, then went to Prague (his parents were Czechoslovakian). He toured Dresden, Berlin, and Munich. The paintings he sought out-works by Rembrandt, Titian, Veronese, Cranach, and Holbein&mdash;gave him a new perspective. "I am, for the first, beginning to understand some of the laws the old masters used in their paintings and wonderful things they are too. It was no hit or miss affair with them, neither was it just feeling: but rather real solid laws and facts that not only one used, but they all used."(2)</p><p>In Munich, Vytlacil enrolled at the Royal Academy of Art, where Worth Ryder and Ernest Thurn were fellow students. When Thurn left the Academy for Hofmann's school, Vytlacil soon followed.(3) Vytlacil worked with Hofmann throughout the mid 1920s, first as a student, and subsequently as a teaching assistant. With Thurn, he organized Hofmann's 1924 summer school on the island of Capri.</p><p>The contact with Hofmann made Vytlacil reconsider his own artistic approach. "More and more I realize that drawing is the bottom of it all and to paint without being able to draw leads only to grief."(4)</p><p>Vytlacil returned to the United States in 1928. During the summer of that year, at Ryder's invitation, he gave a series oflectures on modern European art at the University of California at Berkeley. The next fall he joined the faculty of the Art Students League. Although he encountered opposition from Reginald Marsh, Boardman Robinson, and Kenneth Hayes Miller at the league, Vytlacil gave a series of public lectures on modern art that had lasting importance. George L.K. Morris was only one of many young Americans lured into modernism after hearing Vytlacil speak.</p><p>Vytlacil returned to Europe after a season at the league. In Munich he attempted to interest Hofmann in teaching at the league. He then set up a studio in Paris, where he gained first-hand knowledge of Picasso, Matisse, and Dufy. Over the next six years, Vytlacil divided his time between Paris, Capri, and Positano. In 1931, he took a five-year lease on a villa in Positano and opened an informal school. He returned to New York in 1935, and the following year helped found the American Abstract Artists. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, he taught at a variety of places&mdash;the Art Students League, Queens College in New York, Black Mountain College in North Carolina, the College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, California, and other art schools. In 1946, he rejoined the faculty of the Art Students League and remained there until his retirement in 1978.(5)</p><p>Even before Vytlacil went to Europe, his paintings showed a decided inclination toward modernism. In the expressionistic <i>Village Scene</i> of 1918, and other work from the the same decade, Vytlacil compressed space and balanced his compositions through an adroit use of color. His still lifes and interiors from the 1920s reflect an understanding of C&eacute;anne gleaned partly from his discussions with Hofmann:</p><p>"No one in my former period of training had ever spoken of the properties of the two-dimensional plane, that planes built volumes, not lines, that volumes were three-dimensional and that the negative space in which they exist also has a three-dimensional volume."(6)</p><p>During the 1930s, Vytlacil pursued two distinct and very different kinds of art simultaneously. Landscapes and cityscapes of the early 1930s, such as <i>City Scene #10</i> and <i>Theater District,</i> merge Cubist-inspired spatial concerns with an expressionistic approach to line and color. He also began doing constructions. These were usually of discarded wood from a department store opposite his studio. He occasionally added cardboard, string, metal, and cork to these works.(7) Though he experimented with constructions for several years, Vytlacil eventually gave them up as too limiting. He continued to prefer the spatial challenges of painting. Over the years Vytlacil occasionally ventured into complete nonobjectivity; still most of his work is abstracted from recognizable subjects.</p><p>During the 1940s and 1950s there was a new found freedom in Vytlacil's paintings. Energy replaced form as primary concern, and his subjects&mdash;landscapes, still lifes, the human figure&mdash;possessed a spontaneity unsuspected from his earlier work.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"5183","Artist Biography","<p>In 1972, alter nearly a decade working primarily as a sculptor in metals, Peter Voulkos returned to ceramics. In the mid-1950s, he had virtually reinvented the field by introducing into clay, issues and techniques previously restricted to contemporary painting and sculpture. In the early 1970s Voulkos concentrated on two basic ceramic forms: three-tiered, sculptural "stack pots," and large, stoneware platters. He had first experimented with platelike forms in the late 1950s and early 1960s, slashing, gouging, pinching, tearing, and rearranging their common, archetypal shapes. Typically, he spontaneously brushed vivid slips, or epoxy paints onto their altered surfaces. By contrast, the new series of platters were very different.</p>
<p>During 1973&ndash;74, Voulkos produced a limited edition of two hundred decorated earthenware plates, specifically for a multiples project initiated by curator Lee Nordness. Although wheel-thrown by an assistant, the surfaces of these rather uniform discs were decorated by Voulkos himself. Often, he
began by drawing two or three sharp lines across their still-soft faces with a knife. Then, with his thumbs, he pressed hard from the underside, producing eruptions ("pass-throughs") on the leather-hard face of the plate. He also often pushed right through the ceramic body, tearing out pieces of clay, and leaving ragged holes. Frequently, Voulkos plugged the smaller holes and pass-throughs with lumps, or balls of smooth, white porcelain to generate tonal and textural contrasts. But by leaving gaping perforations in the concave surface, the artist deliberately introduced light and space into the aesthetic equation.</p>
<p>By 1976, when <i>Untitled</i> [1993.54.21] was made, Voulkos' interest in the platter shape had increased markedly. He now threw the plates himself, often giving them a more sculptural character by varying the thickness of the rims. Voulkos viewed the circular format as a thick, three-dimensional plane on whose surface he could fuse his continuing interest in both abstract expressionist drawing and sculpture. The artist actually exhibited his circular forms as "plate drawings," and indeed, each manipulated surface suggests a landscape image, a different configuration, or plotting of space.</p>
<p>In contrast to his aggressively manipulated plate shapes of the late 1950s, the uniform disks of the 1970s reveal a more classical and reductive aesthetic. Each is a variation on a simple theme. Sgraffito markings and surface perforations are relatively restrained, and often kept to a minimum. Moreover, unlike his earlier series of slip-decorated plate forms, the later series is essentially monochromatic. Generally uncolored, the platters retain their natural, cream-to-brick, earthenware tonality. Surface incisions and pass-throughs, however, were lightly washed with oxide for shading purposes, and then the plates were sprayed with a thin, transparent glaze. Although fired in a gas kiln, their natural coloration gave them a traditional, Japanese wood-fired appearance. Voulkos continued to make plates, but after 1978, they became larger and more sculptural, with greater variegations in color and tone.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

After 1887, Mary returned to western Canada almost every summer with her brothers and became an active mountain climber, outdoorswoman, and photographer.

"5210","Artist Biography","<p>About 1935, only five years before his untimely death at age thirty-five, Stuart Walker converted to abstract art. Originally from Indiana, Walker had studied at the Herron School of Art in Indianapolis and for many years was a naturalistic painter. After he moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, Walker frequently chose his subject matter from the state's landscape and the distinctive architectural forms of its Spanish-style churches. In addition, horses, native women, and the Southwest's unique plant life were favored themes. Yet when Walker turned to abstract work, his commitment was total. He began exhibiting his new paintings immediately in Denver and throughout the Southwest.</p><p>When the Transcendental Painting Group was organized, Walker was an original member. His artistic concernsparalleled those of Raymond Jonson and other members of the group, and he showed with them at the Golden Gate International exhibition in San Francisco in 1939.  He was concerned in his paintings with the convergence of planar forms and architectural structure. The exploration of rhythmic form in a painting&mdash;a parallel concern to Raymond Jonson's work at this time&mdash;became a major artistic interest. Like others in the Transcendental Painting Group, Walker hoped to appeal directly to the viewer's senses. In many of his paintings, including <i>Composition #61</i>, he used anonymous titles to avoid any reference to the natural world he had artistically left behind.</p><p>Fellow members of the Transcendental Painting Group believed Walker had just begun to realize his artistic promise when he died.

"5251","Artist Biography","<p>Few landscape photographers gained such national acclaim as Carleton Watkins.  Born in Oneonta, New York, he left for California in 1851 at the age of twenty-two.  After a brief apprenticeship in a portrait photography gallery, he was in business for himself by 1861.  Unlike most studio owners, however, Watkins gave up the financial security of gallery portraiture for the more sporadic opportunities in landscape photography.  He made his first trip to Yosemite in the fall of 1861, producing thirty mammoth-plate and one hundred stereoscopic negatives.  They were among the first photographs of the valley sent back east.  It was partly based on this material that President Lincoln signed a bill in 1864 banning development in the valley, which led to the establishment of the national-parks system.  Over the next twenty years Watkins returned to the valley at least seven times.  His achievement prompted others, such as photographer Charles R. Savage, to refer to Watkins as "the most advanced in the photographic art...who has produced, with his camera, results second to none in either the eastern or western hemispheres."</p><p>In the early 1860s Watkins began photographing mines for clients who required views of geographic features as evidence in legal cases involving land.  <i>The Mining and Scientific Press,</i> always interested in the content of such images, especially praised Watkin's work:  "[The pictures]...are really masterpieces of the photographic art, and present the most perfect and life-like representations of hydraulic mining we have ever seen on paper."  The <i>Press</i> was even more enthusiastic about the utility of the photographs for the mining industry itself:  "The accurate distinctness with which [the sites] are shown, in connection with the topography of the country, timber, etc., is really remarkable, and affords another instance of the value of the photographic art in aiding the engineer to describe the progress and condition of his work."  When the mining operation caused pollution and destructive flooding, Watkins's photographs became the first used as court evidence in an environmental suit.</p><p>In the winter of 1873&ndash;74 Watkins traveled to Utah with the landscape painter William Keith.  On this expedition his photographic wagon rode "piggyback" on a specially designed car on the Union Pacific Railroad.  A newspaper reporter described the trip:  "The chartered two railroad cars...one of which contained the horses, wagon, hay, and feed, while the other was supplied with all the appointments requisite for domestic life."  Along the way, Watkins photographed geological formations, among them Witches Rock. [SAAM, 1994.89.4]</p><p>Merry A.

On his return to New York in 1909, Weber emerged as a prominent figure in avant-garde circles. Weber's early paintings reflect his fascination with Futurist themes, Cubist space, and Fauve color, although around 1917 religious motifs assume increasing importance. During the second decade of the century Weber supported himself primarily by lecturing, and his 1916 Essays on Art were based on his teachings at the White School of Photography. Although Weber had a retrospective show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1930, it wasn't until the 1940s that his work received widespread public attention. His early experimental approach had by this time given way to an expressionistic style, and his canvases were frequent prizewinners in national exhibitions.</P>

"5302","Artist Biography","<p>"Hollyhocking," Weir's term for embellishing the scenery in his paintings, allowed the artist to realize his vision of a pastoral New England. If a painting needed just the right bit of color to balance the composition or to blot out some unsightly feature, Weir simply added a hollyhock, the most genteel of all New England flora. The practice of "hollyhocking," or taking artistic license, did not run in the family. Weir's father, the painter Robert W. Weir, taught drawing at the United States Military Academy at West Point, a job that stressed topographic precision. The younger Weir learned to draw at his father's knee before traveling to Paris in 1873 to study with Jean L&eacute;on G&eacute;r&ocirc;me at the &Eacute;cole des Beaux-Arts. This academic training made Weir initially disdainful of impressionism. Purchasing a farm in Branchville, Connecticut, helped bring about a change of heart and a shift in style as Weir took to the outdoors and began experimenting with a lighter palette and broader brushwork. During this period he also became an important leader in the art world, organizing the upstart group known as "The Ten," before moving on to serve in increasingly conservative positions, such as president of the National Academy of Design and trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. As time went on, critics chided Weir for his prosaic style of painting. Weir's answer to these charges: add another hollyhock.</p><p>William H. Truettner and Roger B.

"5361","Artist Biography","<p>Frederick J. Whiteman considers himself an analytical painter, an approach that grew out of childhood interests in motors, electricity, and radio instruments. Like a scientist or engineer, he visually dissects his subjects to understand the nature and function of their constituent elements and rebuilds as he seeks new expressive possibilities.</p><p>Whiteman grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania and on a farm in Indiana. From an early age he worked with his father, a merchant, contractor, and distributor of electrical, mine, and railway supplies. Cultural activity in his rural Indiana focused on music and theater, rather than the visual arts, and Whiteman became a musician at an early age. But Whiteman was also an inveterate draftsman and did character drawings to amuse his classmates. In high school he enrolled in a correspondence art course, and although he calls his early drawings stiff, mediocre, and pale, by the time he was sixteen he had developed sufficient ability to obtain employment as an engineering draftsman after the death of his father left the family in financial straits.(1)</p><p>After completing high school in 1927, Whiteman studied for a year with Alexander J. Kostellow in Pittsburgh, and from 1930 to 1932 he worked with Jan Matulka and Eugene Fitch at the Art Students League in New York City. During these early years, Whiteman made a living working in the art department of a Brooklyn advertising agency. Yet he was already a committed modernist, and by 1935 he was one of the few young artists to be included in the Whitney Museum's controversial <i>Abstract Art in America</i> exhibition.</p><p>After several years in the advertising business, Whiteman began teaching privately. With Kostellow, he hoped to establish a school for modern art in which students would study design and work in a school factory to produce commercially viable products. Based partly on Bauhaus ideas of the unity of art and life, the school did not materialize. When the Federal Art Project was established, Whiteman joined the teaching project. From 1937 to 1939, he served as director of the WPA art centers in Greensboro, North Carolina, and Greenwich, Mississippi.(2) He returned to New York in 1939, and the following year joined the faculty at Pratt Institute, where he remained until his retirement in 1974.</p><p>Whiteman's paintings of the 1930s reflect a highly developed understanding of the principles of artistic structure, space, and color. Much of his work, including the 1935 <i>Still Life with Pitcher,</i> is Cubist in inspiration and spatial arrangement, although the compositional arrangement of Italian Renaissance art has also contributed to his ideas about space. Never a theoretical artist, Whiteman concentrated on teaching his students to see with analytical eyes and to evaluate form, space, color, and structural line in objective terms.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

Died 25 February 1910, Summit, N.J.</p><p>The five oil paintings by Whittredge in the NMAA [now Smithsonian American Art Museum] span his artistic career&mdash;from his youthful sojourn in Europe to the last decade of his life&mdash;and reveal the artist's substantial talent and rather wide range of stylistic and thematic interests. His early studies with the D&uuml;sseldorf painter Andreas Achenbach resulted for a time in a dependence on the mannerisms of German landscape art (high-keyed palette and exaggerated grandeur of view, for example). Of the fellow Americans with whom he traveled and painted in Europe, only Sanford Gifford, whom he met in Rome, seems to have made an impression on his style. Throughout his career, though receptive to influences, Whittredge was seldom imitative for long. He exhibits, instead, an ability to assimilate the example of others in an individual manner.</p><p>His <i>Interior of a Westphalian Cottage</i> (1852), painted in Germany, has many parallels in contemporary European genre painting. Scenes of picturesque rural poverty, set in gloomy interiors romantically enhanced with rays and patches of light, can be found in pictures of Brittany (especially by French, English, and American artists), and in Dutch, German, and Swiss painting. Whittredge's effects of light are coupled with a spontaneous brushwork that both textures the surface and provides numerous linear accents.  Later, in America, the artist produced a group of domestic, middle-class interiors (some in collaboration with Eastman Johnson ), which are more realistic and less sentimental and condescending than their European counterparts, in which poverty is perfumed and prettified.</p><p><i>Sakonnet Point, Rhode Island</i> (ca. 1880) handsomely represents a landscape type recurrent in Whittredge's work after his 1866 trip to the western plains: a simple, open horizontal view, uncluttered and tranquil. Especially important is a group of paintings done in Rhode Island in the early eighties, which recall the Newport work of John F. Kensett. Shoreline, dunes, and spits of land are arranged in quiet bands, articulated with simple curves (here the road) and orchestrated with a warm, gentle palette. Probably painted on the spot, <i>Sakonnet Point</i> is calm and unhurried, an intimate amble for the eye.</p><p>At the age of eighty Whittredge's eye may have been turning inward when he painted <i>Noon in the Orchard</i> (1900), a painting that evokes the spirit of New England Transcendentalism.

"5403","Artist Biography","<p>A traditional Navajo sheepherder, Charlie Willeto began carving in the early 1960s, only a few years before his death. He used his works as barter&#8212;a standard form of trade on the reservation&#8212;for groceries at the Mauzy Trading Post near Lybrook. Jim Mauzy accepted Willeto's carvings, although they differed from the more conventional Navajo crafts of weaving and silverwork. Only one other life-sized carving exists; most of Willeto's four hundred figures range in size from twelve to thirty inches.</p><p>Willeto's figures came from a heritage of carving that had little to do with commercial signs. A Navajo curing rite, 'aw&eacute;&eacute;sh&iacute;&iacute;n'an&aacute;ln&eacute;&eacute;h, prominently featured the carving of human figurines. These were usually between four and eight inches long, and were used only in a religious context specific to that ceremony. After the rite's completion, the doll-like carvings were usually taken to sacred sites and left with paired male and female prayer sticks. Willeto's statuesque figures are almost identical in form to many of these small, stylized carvings found in regions of the reservation where 'aw&eacute;&eacute;sh&iacute;&iacute;n'an&aacute;ln&eacute;&eacute;h was performed. The painted markings may be decorative reminders of the jeweled inlay and painted bands found on many surviving examples of the figures.</p><p>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan <i>Made with Passion: The Hemphill Folk Art Collection in the National Museum of American Art</i> (Washington, D.C. and London: National Museum of American Art with the Smithsonian Institution Press, 1990)</p>",""

"5470","Artist Biography","<p class="noindent">Wood's brand of Midwestern regionalism has often been seen as a response to his own youth, spent on an Iowa farm and in the town of Cedar Rapids. These years were perhaps idealized when he looked back on them from Chicago and Paris, where he went for artistic training. He returned to Cedar Rapids with a mildly avant-garde direction to his work, which he first applied to decorative arts and design. By 1930, he had developed a distinctive painting style&mdash;a kind of meticulous, down-to-earth realism&mdash;that he imposed on the Iowa landscape. Wood's compositions, consisting of neatly ordered farms, generously spaced across a wide horizon, led viewers to believe that at the heart of America lay the virtues of agrarian life. Twice Wood ventured into colonial fables, painting the <i>Midnight Ride of Paul Revere</i> and then <i>Parson Weems' Fable.</i> Both works, done in a tidy realistic style and featuring spacious rolling Iowa landscapes, are noteworthy for their "midwestern" approach to colonial history.</p><p>William H.

"5505","Artist Biography","<p>Jean Xceron, Greek by birth, came to the United States when he was fourteen years old. For the next six years he lived and worked with relatives in Pittsburgh, Indianapolis, and New York City. In 1910, determined to be an artist, he moved to Washington, D.C., and enrolled in classes at the Corcoran School of Art. At the Corcoran, where the curriculum focused on the traditional academic practice of drawing from plaster casts, Xceron perfected his skills as a draftsman. He first encountered modernism when, in 1916, two fellow students arranged an exhibition of avant-garde paintings borrowed from Alfred Stieglitz. The show made a deep impression on Xceron, whose own appreciation for flat color and expressive distortion paralleled the work being done by others.</p><p>In 1920, Xceron moved to New York and became friends with Joaquin Torres-Garcia, Max Weber, Abraham Walkowitz, and Joseph Stella. He exhibited in the New York Independents' exhibitions in 1921 and 1922. In New York, Xceron studied C&eacute;anne and read as much as possible about new artistic movements abroad. Xceron was finally able to travel to Paris in 1927. There he began writing reviews of the latest in art for the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i> and the Paris edition of the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> His articles on Jean H&eacute;lion, Hans Arp, John Graham, Theo Van Doesburg, and other artists showed his increasingly sophisticated understanding of recent art. About the same time, his own painting underwent a dramatic transition. As a writer, he was quickly accepted into the Parisian art world as one of the few critics sympathetic to modern art; but few realized that Xceron was an accomplished painter as well. Soon, however, members of the Parisian Greek community became aware of Xceron's talents, and Christian Zervos, editor of the influential magazine <i>Cahiers d'Art,</i> arranged a solo exhibition at the Gal&egrave;rie de France in 1931. Visitors to this first exhibition saw an artist who was working his way through Cubism.  Still-life and figural motifs remained prominent, but the artist was striving to capture rhythmic and fluid movement rather than solid form. Over the next several years, Xceron moved away from his figural foundations, introducing at first gridlike structural patterns and, by the mid 1930s, planar arrangements of severe Constructivist purity.</p><p>When Xceron returned to New York in 1935 for an exhibition at the Garland Gallery, he was among the inner circle of  <i>Abstraction-Cr&eacute;ation</i> and other leading Parisian art groups. Moreover, he had achieved some reputation. He again visited New York in 1937 for a show at Nierendorf Gallery. Although planning only a visit, his move proved permanent. Xceron soon joined the American Abstract Artists, who welcomed him as a leading Parisian artist. Despite his reputation, however, he fared little better commercially than did his new colleagues. He was hired by the WPA Federal Art Project and executed an abstract mural for the chapel at Riker's Island Penitentiary. In 1939 he began working for the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, where he remained for the rest of his career.</p> <p><i>Portrait No. 61</i> and<i>Portrait No. 38</i>, both of 1932, represent midway points in Xceron's artistic development. Created several years after his move to Paris, they reflect Xceron's simultaneous commitment to a tactile surface and the rhythmic movement of line and form. By the early thirties, Xceron was fully indoctrinated into the aesthetics of De Stijl, but had not yet accepted the geometric formulation of spatial balance that would shape his work during the mid 1930s. The muted palette of soft gray tones in the portraits had not yet yielded to the vibrant, almost optical color that became his hallmark during the geometric phase of his work. By the late 1930s, Xceron's paintings took on striking similarities to Kandinsky's work of the mid 1920s, and works like <i>Watercolor #308</i> (1947) show parallels with the paintings of Rudolf Bauer that played so prominent a role in the exhibitions Hilla Rebay presented at the Guggenheim Foundation and later at the at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting. This connection with Rebay meant that Xceron never became closely involved with the inner circle of the American Abstract Artists. They, for the most part, rejected the mystical notions of art propounded by the influential baroness.(1)</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"5515","Artist Biography","<p>"I tell you&mdash;There's few places I haven't been&mdash;of any size that is. And there's nothing I haven't suffered to see things first hand." &mdash;Joseph Yoakum, quoted in Christine Ramberg, <i>diary excerpts, 29 May 1969,</i> <i>Whitney Halstead Papers</i>: 2 (Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.)</p><br /><p>Athough Joseph Yoakum gave vastly different accounts of his background, he was, throughout his life, classified as an African American. Sometimes Yoakum claimed that he was a full-blooded "Nava-joe" Indian, one of twelve or thirteen children born to a farmer on an Indian reservation in Window Rock, Arizona. At other times he insisted that he was of African-American descent. He described his mother as a strong woman who was a doctor and knowledgeable in the use of herbal medicines. Yoakum's family moved to Kansas City, Missouri, during his early childhood. His father was employed briefly in the railroad yards prior to settling permanently on a farm in nearby Walnut Grove in southwest Missouri. Although Yoakum said that his formal schooling consisted of only three or four months, the character of the notations on his drawings suggests greater exposure to formal training.</p><p>The early years of Yoakum's life were apparently nomadic. He claimed to have run away from home during his early teens to join a circus. He also claimed to have worked with Buffalo Bill before 1903, when he became the personal valet of John Ringling of the Ringling Brothers Circus. Between 1905 and 1910, Yoakum may have visited Europe, Russia, Mexico, the Middle East, China, Siberia, Canada, Central America, and South America. His first marriage occurred around 1910 and produced five children. He married again in 1929.</p><p>Yoakum served in the Unites States Army during World War I and was stationed at one time in France. The specific location and nature of his activities after his military discharge until his artistic career began in the early 1960s are uncertain. Yoakum said that he worked at a variety of jobs throughout the United States. In the early 1940s, he and his wife operated an ice cream parlor on Chicago's South Side. By the late 1950s, however, Yoakum was widowed, retired, and living in a housing project for the elderly in Chicago. In 1966, Yoakum moved from the project to a storefront on the South Side. He lived there until he was hospitalized and placed in a nursing home in 1971; he died there the following year.</p><p>According to Yoakum, he was motivated to draw as the result of a dream around 1962. He described his process of working as a "spiritual enfoldment," meaning that his imagery was revealed as he worked. Yoakum's earliest drawings were done on small pieces of white or Manila paper with pen or pencil and little or no color. He graduated to larger pieces of paper and applied more color to his drawings as he drew with greater frequency.</p><p>Although Yoakum enjoyed doing celebrity-oriented portraits, the majority of his drawings are landscapes. In his hundreds of variations, real or imagined, mountains and water are the major themes. Between 1965 and 1970, Yoakum drew constantly and sometimes completed several pictures a day, often similar in theme, yet distinctly different in design. He kept an assortment of travel books, an atlas, and the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> and took great pains to include inscriptions that name geographical details ranging from valleys to continents. Nonetheless, the scenes in Yoakum's landscapes are generally not identifiable. Yoakum usually signed and dated his landscapes in the upper left corner. Occasionally he used a rubber stamp to indicate the date&#151;adding what he called a "touch of class." Yoakum's world was intensely private. His religious beliefs were rooted in the view that God and nature were the same thing. He expressed this belief in hundreds of drawings that are delicate, sensitive, and poetic&#151;in contrast to the bold, if not brash, character of most contemporary folk art.</p><p>Regenia A.

"5519","Artist Biography","<p>Beckford Young became associated with the American Abstract Artists after he returned from an extended stay in Europe. The son of a builder in Petaluma, California, Young learned carpentry at an early age, and while still in his teens, built a house on his own. A high school athlete, Young passed up a football scholarship. Instead, he decided to attend the University of California at Berkeley, where he was influenced by John Haley and Worth Ryder. It was Ryder, Hans Hofmann's former student in Munich, who arranged the summer teaching position that first brought Hofmann to the United States.(1) And it was Ryder who introduced Young to Hofmann's ideas. When Hofmann himself arrived in Berkeley, he took Young under his wing. Hofmann advised Young to forget everything he had learned, and draw using only ink and a matchstick. When Hofmann returned to Germany, he convinced Young to join him, although when Hofmann decided to move permanently to the United States, his student remained abroad. In Berlin he met and married Janet Todd. From Germany, the couple traveled to Rome, and then to Positano, the art colony on the coast of Italy where Vaclav Vytlacil held summer classes. Later Young described his time in Positano as his most creative and prolific period. However, little of the work from that time remains today. In Positano, Young worked closely with Vytlacil and also studied fresco painting, attempting to duplicate ancient Pompeian techniques.</p><p>In 1937, with the political situation worsening in Europe, the Youngs returned to California, where Beckford joined theWPA.(2) His newly acquired expertise in fresco led to immediate employment on mural projects for federal buildings in the San Francisco Bay area. In 1938, he transferred to the Sacramento project, where he organized an art school and gallery. Although he also taught painting, his primary responsibilities in Sacramento were administrative. Subsequently Young managed a variety of WPA projects in Oakland and San Francisco, where he served as art director until the WPA came to an end.(3)</p><p>Young was deeply committed to the WPA's concept of public art. He believed art should be integrated with life and should make a positive contribution to the community. Much of the work he did on the WPA was directed toward educating children to the beauty and enjoyment of creating works of art.</p><p>During World War II, Young did camouflage work for the armed forces and served in other art related fields. In the 1950s and 1960s, he completed mural commissions for various hotels and other public spaces. He also worked for a residential construction firm, and during the early 1960s handled remodeling projects for the Hilton Hotel chain.</p><p>Living in California, Beckford Young was a long-distance member of the American Abstract Artists and exhibited in several of its early annual exhibitions. He considered himself an experimental, rather than an abstract artist, who incorporated Hofmann's ideas into a body of work that was, for the most part, representational. The dramatic white <i>Construction,</i> in which the artist attached architectural moldings, strips of wood, and other found objects to a door, was an unusual work for Young. It owes a conceptual debt to Russian Constructivism, yet is stylistically closer to Vytlacil's constructed work of the 1930s than to that of Pevsner, Gabo, or Tatlin. Young's admiration for Vytlacil is perhaps most clearly revealed in the <i>Untitled</i> gouache of about 1938. The compressed space of the figures, defiant of the implied dimensionality of the brick foreground and building, relates directly to a short-lived classical phase of Vytlacil's work during the 1930s.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"5521","Artist Biography","<p>The daughter of a Congregationalist minister and the oldest of four children, Janet Young was raised in Illinois. She received her bachelor's degree in languages from Oberlin College in Ohio; her fluency in Italian, French, and German later led to work as a translator for the United States government during World War II. After graduating from Oberlin, Young traveled to Germany, where she helped her father organize European tours for school teachers. In Germany she discovered the Bauhaus, and while she never attended its classes, the fertile environment had a lasting effect on her work. During the early 1930s, she spent much of her time in Berlin. It was there that she met and married Beckford Young, a California art student who had gone to Germany to study with Hans Hofmann.(1) Shortly after their marriage, the Youngs traveled in Italy, and spent a summer at the art colony in Positano where Vaclav Vytlacil was teaching.</p><p>This period was a productive one for Janet Young. The artist was already committed to developing a personal language of abstraction based on Constructivist ideas. Young continued to experiment with Constructivism after she and her husband returned to California in 1937. Although the early complex wooden assemblages she exhibited in the 1938 annual of the American Abstract Artists are now lost, it is apparent from photographs that Young had thoroughly assimilated the Constructivist aesthetic. In them she combined rectangular wood cutouts, half-round and serrated wood moldings with spherical and hemispherical shapes, and possibly plastics within a shallow relief format. Tightly composed into architectural structures, they are concerned with the balance of static and dynamic form.</p><p>Unlike Beckford Young, from whom she was divorced, Janet Young pursued an abstract style throughout her career.(2) Until the 1960s, when she introduced color into her work, she concentrated primarily on stark, black-and-white compositions, and frequently worked with collage. <i>Collage #17</i> and <i>Collage #20,</i> in which Young assembled clippings from magazines and newspapers into articulate, architectural compositions, are typical of her work during this period.(3)</p><br /><br /><p>1.

"5564","Artist Biography","<p>Best known today as a sculptor, Wilfrid Zogbaum began his art career as a modernist painter. He was the son of an admiral and the grandson of Rufus Fairchild Zogbaum, an artist-illustrator who covered the Spanish-American War. As a child, Zogbaum traveled extensively in Europe, and spoke French and German fluently. In high school, he spent two summers studying painting and drawing at the Rhode Island School of Design. In 1933 he enrolled for a year at the Yale School of Art, but left to go to New York where he studied initially with John Sloan. Beginning in 1935, Zogbaum attended Hans Hofmann's school, where, with Giorgio Cavallon and George McNeil, he served as a class monitor.</p>
<p>Zogbaum described Hofmann as "the only prophet of modern art in America." He believed, with Hofmann, in the importance of nature within art: " &#133; when art gets too far away from nature or from ordinary things it begins to lose itself in a kind of &#133; glorious mist."(1) Some of Zogbaum's paintings from this time, such as the 1936 <i>Untitled Abstraction,</i> evoke the color of the Provincetown landscape where Hofmann had a summer school. However, in the <i>Untitled Abstraction</i> (ca. 1934&ndash;39), the visual connection with nature is more elusive, based perhaps on the unseen structures of the world.</p><p>By 1937, when Zogbaum won a Guggenheim Fellowship to Europe, he was already a member of the American Abstract Artists. The trip to Europe, though, proved significant. Zogbaum met Ben Nicholson, Naum Gabo, and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy in London. In Paris he met Wassily Kandinsky and developed a close friendship with Fernand L&eacute;ger, a relationship that continued after the Frenchman fled to New York to escape the war. But Zogbaum spent most of his fellowship year in Bavaria, where he associated with Fritz Winter and other former Bauhaus teachers. Returning to New York, Zogbaum painted independently for two years. In 1942, he joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps as a photographer and was with the first U.S. troops to liberate the Pacific islands.</p><p>During the late 1940s, Zogbaum became a successful commercial photographer in New York. But in 1948 he left this career to devote himself full time to his art. He exhibited frequently during the 1950s in group and solo exhibitions, and became well known as an Abstract.  During the mid 1950s, he began making sculpture, initially as a supplement to his painting, and for several years divided his time between the two media.(2) By the late 1950s, however, a decision to temporarily stop painting became a permanent choice. Given his love for nature, it is not surprising that many of his early sculptures are animals and figures. These were often made of discarded machine parts and other found objects, whose identities became submerged within a total statement:</p><p>Most of my sculpture has been made with the methods and materials at hand. One of these is the beach-stone which seemed a means of introducing a solid volume into the open cage-like structure of steel. At first it was used as a head-like part in a somewhat human or animal image. Later in a more abstract sense and in counterpoise with other objects within the image in a variety of meanings.(3)</p><p>In 1957 Zogbaum taught for a semester at the University of California at Berkeley. This position was followed by short-term teaching posts at the University of Minnesota, Southern Illinois University, and at Pratt Institute in New York, and a return year at Berkeley in 1961&ndash;62.</p><br /><br /><p>1.

Today, however, Marguerite Thompson Zorach's reputation is largely overshadowed by that of her sculptor husband, William. And yet the attention Marguerite attracted should come as no surprise. She was an early exponent of modernism in America, employing the bold colors of the Fauves (a group of radical French painters) with the striking, and controversial, forms of cubism. Marguerite's modernist credentials were impeccable. An acquaintance of Pablo Picasso and the expatriate Gertrude Stein, she attended La Palette, a school of "post-impressionists," and exhibited at the Salon d'Automne and the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Artistes Ind&eacute;pendants.</p>
<p>She married William in 1912, returned to the United States, and together they began summering in New England. After several restless seasons in New Hampshire and Provincetown, Massachusetts, the Zorachs purchased a farm in Robinhood Cove near Stonington, Maine.

In December 1910 he went to France intending to pursue a career as an academic painter, but Marguerite Thompson, his future wife, introduced him to avant-garde painting in the salons of Paris. Zorach's paintings in the second decade of this century demonstrate his fascination with Fauvism and Cubism, but ten years of avant-garde experimentation exhausted his enthusiasm and in 1922 he gave up painting for sculpture. Zorach's stone and wood carvings and his work in plaster and terra cotta are stylistically rooted in Egyptian, Greek, and, to some degree, in primitive art. His family members were frequent subjects, as were the family pets, and much of Zorach's art explores nuances of human emotion.

"5567","Artist Biography","<p class="noindent">Not until 1917, well into a career as a lithographer and painter, did Zorach take up sculpture. His earliest works appear to have followed his painting style, a kind of angular cubism that in the third dimension reinforced the "primitive" style of his carving. Most works of this period resemble African or medieval sculpture. But soon after he took his lead from an aesthetic of direct carving, allowing the material in which he was working to guide him toward an artistic solution. By the 1930s, sculpture in stone, mostly of human figures, constituted Zorach's major output.</p>
<p>Zorach was the son of a Lithuanian immigrant who settled in Cleveland. He was trained at the Cleveland School of Art as a lithographer, then studied painting in Paris in 1910 and 1911. Four of his works were accepted at the Salon d'Automne in the latter year. He continued to paint, especially in watercolor, during summers spent at Robinhood Cove near Stonington, Maine. The subjects he chose, coastal views of Penobscot Bay, suggest a link to the animals he carved from the granite that lined the shores of the bay. Both watercolors and sculpture were meant to evoke a spirit of place, the former by representing the liquid atmosphere that merged sky and water, the latter as an expression of the enduring character of the Maine coast. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Zorach worked on commission for the Fine Arts section of the Treasury Department, which presided over the decoration of federal buildings in Washington and post offices in regional cities and towns. The post office program fostered an awareness of national government in local communities; individual projects, however, focused not on "official art" but on local history, commerce, and industry.</p><p>William H.

"5658","Artist Biography","<P>Now in her eighth decade as an artist, Lois Mailou Jones has treated an extraordinary range of subjects—from French, Haitian, and New England landscapes to the sources and issues of African-American culture. The scope of her rigorous training in Boston, New York, Paris, Italy, and Africa is equally evident in her costumes, textile designs, watercolors, paintings, and collages.</P>
<P>In <I>Les Fetiches,</I> [SAAM, 1990.56] an ensemble of African figurative fetishes and masks hovers in space-divorced from any sense of ceremony, display, or storage. The masks have assumed a life of their own, capturing the electrifying magic associated with ritualistic objects. Although often created to conceal identity, masks are equally effective projections or revelations of values, whether personal or cultural. Since the 1920s Jones has studied masks from diverse non-Western civilizations, and in African masks and fetishes she has found powerful keys to infusing art with her ancestry's spirit and meaning. Simultaneously an accurate depiction and poetic synthesis of masks, <I>Les Fetiches</I> also identifies, perhaps unwittingly, the heterogeneous nature of African culture-created by diverse peoples across a vast continent.</P>
<P>By the 1920s both European and African-American artists usednon-Western art to help them break from prevailing formal styles, and Jones followed that lead. Although her early impressionistic style recurs throughout her career, the bold, emblematic qualities of African art have led her toward abstraction, as they had Post-Impressionist and Cubist artists. The planar design and striking color contrasts in <I>Les Fetiches</I> complement the dynamic, essential forms of the objects.</P>
<P>Throughout her career, Jones has championed the international artistic achievement of African-American art. She has also been an important role model for other African-American artists, particularly those involved with her design and watercolor courses at Howard University from 1930 to 1977.</P>

"5658","Artist Biography","<P>"Mine is a quiet exploration—a quest for new meanings in color, texture and design. Even though I sometimes portray scenes of poor and struggling people, it is a great joy to paint." — Lois Mailou Jones quoted in Samella S. Lewis and Ruth G.Waddy, <I>Black Artists on Art</I> (Los Angeles: Contemporary Crafts Publishers, 1969), 1:97.</P>
<P>For more than fifty years, Lois Mailou Jones has enjoyed a consistently successful career as a painter, teacher, book illustrator, and textile designer. Her art spans three continents: North America, Europe, and Africa, and she has been represented in more than seventy group shows and mounted twenty one-woman exhibitions since 1937.
<P>Jones was born in Boston in 1905, the second of two children of Thomas Vreeland and Caroline Dorinda Jones. Jones's father was the first African American to graduate from Boston's Suffolk Law School, and her mother was a beautician. Jones has recalled that her mother fostered her earliest artistic interests and that her teachers in the Boston public schools were encouraging. Jones's initial professional aspirations were to pursue a career in social work. It was, however, the offer of a scholarship for the vocational drawing classes at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts that spurred Jones to a permanent career in art. Initially for one year, her scholarship was extended to six years, based on Jones's outstanding achievements, and when she graduated in 1927 she was also awarded a teacher's certificate. She has received diplomas from the Boston Normal Art School and Designer's School in Boston. She has also studied art at Harvard University and Columbia University.</P>
<P>Jones's first experience with racial prejudice occurred in 1927 when she applied for a graduate assistantship at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts. Her application was flatly rejected and she was advised to travel to the South and help African Americans living there. After briefly considering moving to New York City, Jones was recruited in 1928 by Palmer Memorial Institute, a private African-American boarding school in Sedalia, North Carolina, to head its art department. After two years in North Carolina where she experienced the frustrations and indignities of segregation first-hand, Jones left Palmer Memorial and joined the faculty of the Fine Arts Department at Howard University in Washington, D.C. She remained at Howard as professor of design and watercolor painting for forty-seven years until her retirement in 1977Jones's long career may be divided into four phases: the African-inspired works of the early 1930s, French landscapes, cityscapes, and figure studies from 1937 to 1951, Haitian scenes of the 1950s and 1960s, and the works of the past several decades that reflect a return to African themes. Her formal artistic career began in 1930 when she joined the faculty at Howard University. The racial discrimination that she experienced in Boston and North Carolina, as well as the climate and aftermath of the Harlem Renaissance, motivated the depiction of African and African-American themes in Jones's early paintings. She became associated with the Harmon Foundation shortly after moving to Washington, and was a frequent participant in its exhibitions during the 1930s.</P>
<P>In 1937 Jones received a General Education Board Foreign Fellowship to study in France. She went to Paris in 1937 where she studied painting at the Académie Julian, lived among the French, learned to speak French fluently, and painted views of Paris and surrounding areas. Since her first trip to France, Jones has felt a spiritual affinity for the French people and their nation. She explains that France provided her with the first feeling of absolute freedom to live and eatwherever she chose. Her admiration for France and its people was so profound that she returned to Paris each year, except during World War II, for more than twenty years after her first trip. In 1952, a book of more than one hundred reproductions of her French paintings, <I>Lois Mailou Jones Peintures 1937–1951,</I> was published in Paris. Jones was the only African-American female painter of the 1930s and 1940s to achieve fame abroad, and the earliest whose subjects extend beyond the realm of portraiture.</P>
<P>Jones's third period was also formed outside the United States in Haiti where she discovered a second spiritual home. She first went to the capital, Port-au-Prince, in 1954 when the Haitian government invited her to visit and paint the country's landscape and its people. The trip lasted ten weeks and in that time Jones developed a love for Haiti's warm climate, its beautiful scenery, and its colorful, deeply religious people. She also conducted painting classes at the Centre d'Art and the Foyer des Artes Plastiques. In recognition, the government of Haiti made her a chevalier of the National Order of Honor and Merit.</P>
<P>Haiti acquired even more meaning for Jones following her marriage to Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noel, a prominent Haitian artist. Jones and Pierre-Noel first met in 1934 when they were graduate students at Columbia University. For almost twenty years they corresponded before they eventually married in the south of France in 1953. Jones and her husband lived in Washington, D.C., Martha's Vineyard, and in Pierre-Noel's hometown, Port-au-Prince. They had no children. His death in 1982 ended their twenty-nine year marriage.</P>
<P>Jones's numerous oils and watercolors inspired by Haiti are probably her most widely known works. In them her affinity for bright colors, her understanding of Cubism's basic principles, and her search for a distinctly personal style reached an apogee.</P>
<P>Jones's return to African themes in her work of the past several decades coincided with the black expressionistic movement in the United States during the 1960s. Skillfully integrating aspects of African masks, figures, and textiles into her vibrant paintings, Jones continues to produce exciting new works at an astonishing rate of speed, even in her late eighties.</P>
<P>In 1945 James Lane, curator of painting at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, said of Jones's work, God's gift to Lois Jones is a beautiful sense of color. Like a singer who always sings true, this well-trained painter—and she has studied under Philip Hale, Jonas Lie, and the Académie Julian— shows true harmony in her oils. But that is not God's only gift: He has given her a sense of structure and design (which she uses in her textile patterns) that carries the color to victory, for unorganized color alone could not possibly do the trick. Her work, from her earliest still lifes and her prize-winning portrait <I>French Mother,</I> has, one sees, been responsive to light and the joyousness of light, but where the fine cityscapes of her Paris period were charming and gray, the landscapes, the portraits, and the still lifes from Martha's Vineyard are clarion and colorful. It is all, in the best sense of the word, happy art." It is extraordinary that nearly fifty years later, Jones's paintings, currently inspired by African themes, are still highly reflective of Lane's description.</P>

"5698","Artist Biography","<p>Robert Hamilton Blackburn was known as a "printmaker's printmaker"; if you wanted to make prints you made your way to his workshop in Chelsea [New York City]. The shaky elevator doors would open by a tiny crammed office full of paperwork, the phones constantly ringing. If he wasn't in that office, you'd find him farther back, in the rambling, sunny loft, full of intaglio and litho presses, graining sinks, and rosin boxes, cluttered with tables and mismatched chairs and flat files. Every wall was full of shelving, and every shelf stuffed with papers and tools. Dozens of limestones filled the slots. Off the main space, little rooms opened up: edition rooms for private concentration, a darkroom, the print collection.</p><p>Blackburn was born in Summit, New Jersey, on December 12, 1920, and he passed away on April 21, 2003, in New York City.  In between, he quietly but doggedly influenced the course of American art with his own graphic work. His legendary generosity and the effortless diversity of the workshop have been frequently acknowledged, as well as the impressive fact that he was the first master printer at Universal Limited Art Editions (ULAE). There he produced the initial seventy-nine editions for artists including Helen Frankenthaler, Grace Hartigan, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Larry Rivers. Blackburn's own experimental color lithography before the "print boom" of the early 1960s was crucial. After twenty years of single-minded commitment to lithography, his talents and predilections shaped the forms of printmaking adopted by these better-known artists.</p><p>Growing up in Harlem, Blackburn was influenced by the intellectual and artistic legacies of the Harlem Renaissance, American social realism, Mexican modernism, and European abstraction. In middle school, he studied with poet Countee Cullen and sculptor William Artis. At age thirteen, he enrolled in Charles Alston's Harlem Arts Workshop classes, where he met artist and teacher Ronald Joseph. When Alston initiated his historic "306" salon, Blackburn was one of the youngest participants. From 1934 to 1935 he attended art classes at the Harlem YMCA, and around 1936 became friendly with artists Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight. With Joseph, they attended Augusta Savage's Uptown Art Laboratory. At DeWitt-Clinton High School from 1936 to 1940, Blackburn published his work in the fabled <i>Magpie.</i> He also attended the Harlem Community Art Center, the WPA's largest New York community center, where he learned lithography with Riva Helfond. From 1940 to 1943 he honed his skills at the Art Student's League with mentor Will Barnet. After graduating from the league, and scrambling for arts-related freelance work, Blackburn opened the Printmaking Workshop in 1948.</p><p>With the exception of a European hiatus on a John Hay Whitney Traveling Fellowship (1953&ndash;54) and a fairly full-time stint at ULAE (1957&ndash;63), Blackburn spent the rest of his life heading up his workshop. His own artistic production suffered as a result of this fifty-four year commitment. But when his graphic oeuvre is assessed, we can see why he quickly developed a reputation for complex, multi-stone color lithographic experimentation and technical excellence. His key works shift between cubistic arrangements and color abstractions. In contrast to many African American artists of his generation, Blackburn chose to sidestep the weighty issues brought to the fore by figurative work. He placed his viewers before a window and plane simultaneously, at times conjuring three dimensions but always playfully insisting on the conventions of picturing, and always referring to the sheet, the stone, and the block.</p><p>Concerned with the idea of the printmaking process itself, Blackburn treated his stones with tremendous fluidity, reworking images from all sides, reorienting the image as he progressed and at times signing both the top and bottom. His thinking was horizontal, across the surface of the stone as he moved around on the press bed, calling to mind critic Leo Steinberg's description of Rauschenberg and his reorientation of the viewer down toward the work surface of the artist's table.</p><p>Blackburn also challenged the idea of lithography as a high craft process in his own work as well as in the democracy of his studio. His widely disparate proofs often did not arrive at an edition at all, evacuating the notion of rigidly identical reproduction.  His playfulness and continual variations luxuriate in process, not finish. While his prints were exhibited internationally, a lack of documentation, coupled with his extreme personal modesty, contributed to a lack of appreciation of his achievements.</p><p>Deborah Cullen "Appreciation: Robert Blackburn (1920&ndash;2003): A Printmaker's Printmaker." <i>American Art</i> journal 17, no. 3 (Fall 2003), pp. 92&ndash;94</p>",""

I have resigned myself to this continual ideological conflict in myself, because I believe that it reflects an issue which is preliminary to the amalgamation of cultures which will bring about a true world culture of ideas in the Twenty First Century." Alternative Museum, <I>Keith Morrison: Recent Painting</I> (New York: Athens Printing Company, 1990), 3.</P>
<P>As a child, Keith Morrison drew and painted constantly and dreamed of becoming an artist. Born in Jamaica, Morrison was profoundly influenced by African and Caribbean cultures—influences that were later manifested in his art.</P>
<P>Before graduating from high school in Jamaica, Morrison applied to a number of art schools in Great Britain and the United States. Although he initially wanted to study in Italy, his family wanted him to study in England. A compromise was reached, and Morrison came to the United States. He enrolled in the School of The Art Institute of Chicago where he studied between 1959 and 1965, and earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in art.</P>
<P>After receiving his master's degree, Morrison taught in the public schools of Gary, Indiana. Two years later, Morrison began his career as a university professor, and since that time has taught at Fisk University, DePaul University, the University of Illinois, the University of Chicago, the University of Maryland, Maryland Institute, College of Art, and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Since 1988, he has served as chairman of the art department at the University of Maryland.</P>
<P>While at the Art Institute's school, Morrison received a thorough background in abstract expressionism, and was probably most influenced by the hard-edged abstract paintings of Ellsworth Kelly. Shortly thereafter, Morrison produced his first series of paintings—large, black-and-white, hard-edged abstractions. Although these works were well received and highly acclaimed, they did not satisfy his inner longing to create paintings that more specifically reflected the rich and colorful culture of his homeland. In general, Morrison's black-and-white canvases were generally conventional abstract expressionist works. To the artist, however, they were works of black pride, and an identification with the struggles of African Americans during the civil rights movementof the 1960s. Although Morrison grew up in comfortable middle class circumstances in Jamaica and did not come to the United States until he was seventeen, he experienced racial and professional discrimination following his arrival in this country.</P>
<P>Around 1975, Morrison abandoned hisabstract expressionist style and began to create figural paintings treating African and Caribbean themes. He did not exhibit any of these paintings until the early 1980s. Since that time, Morrison has produced primarily figural works featuring themes that deal with his dual cultural background. His subjects depict lush tropical foliage and colors, and real and imaginary animals and masked dancers. These symbolic paintings vibrate with energy and are haunting in their enigmatic imagery. His subjects are drawn from stories he heard as a child, and the superstitions and voodoo ceremonies of his native environment. Other paintings are celebratory, and reminiscent of theAfro-Caribbean festivals so prominent in that culture. In these works themes of life, death, and rebirth abound. </P>
<P>In addition to his painting and teaching activities, Morrison is a printmaker, writer, critic, and curator. He has organized a number of important exhibitions, and is the author of the well-known exhibition catalogue, <I>Art in Washington and its Afro-American Presence:1940-1970.</I></P>
<P>Morrison has always been fascinated by ponds at dusk, from which evil spirits emerge according to legend. In <I>Zombie Jamboree,</I> the figure wearing white was based in part on <I>Hamlet</I>'s tragic heroine Ophelia, and in part by that powerful evocation of nature, Igor Stravinsky's <I>Rite of Spring.</I> The image of ghosts dancing across a pond in Benjamin Britten's opera, <I>The Turn of the Screw,</I> also influenced this painting, Morrison has said. The enigmatic floating figure recalls an event from the artist's childhood. An adult friend of the Morrison family was drowned—or committed suicide—in a pond at dusk, and this event has left an indelible imprint on the artist. In addition, the rising mummified figure is symbolic of death and resurrection, and is an image that appears in several of his works of the same period.</P>
<P>Morrison's African heritage can be seen in the upper section of the painting in which small dancing figures wearing African masks are joined by a skeletal form. These figures reinforce the voodoo themes of the work, which celebrate both the agony of death and the joy of resurrection.</P>

"5740","Artist Biography","<p>William Dunlap says of Washington Allston that he was "number one" in the catalogue of American painters or at least only second to his great master and precursor, Benjamin West.

Something of the impact of the man is reflected in contemporaries' tributes. Horatio Greenough, the sculptor, counted himself among those "who owed to Allston the birth of their souls." And some years after his death, Longfellow wrote, "One man may sweeten a whole town. I never pass through Cambridgeport without thinking of Allston. His memory is the quince in the drawer, and perfumes the atmosphere."</p><p>Allston was educated in a school in his native Charleston, prepared for college at Newport, and went to Harvard, where he graduated with honors and was the class poet. After leaving college, he sold his share of the family property in order to finance his study abroad. In 1801 he sailed for England; from 1804 to 1808 he was in Italy, mostly in Rome. Here he first met Coleridge, who became a life-long friend. During his second stay in England and after the death of his first wife, Allston, like his friend Coleridge, joined the Episcopal church. In 1818 he was elected honorary member of the American Academy of Fine Arts and in the same year he returned to the United States, to live the rest of his life in Boston, Cambridge, and Cambridgeport. In 1827 his first exhibition was held at the Boston Athenaeum. In 1830 he married the sister of the poet Richard H.

"5742","Artist Biography","<P>"I think my heritage has a great significance to the images I produce, but you can limit people with a name or a title to only serve one group. When you see my work, you can tell it is done by someone who is Black. But, I want to provide as many beautiful things to the world as I possibly can." — Frederick Brown, quoted in Eve M. Ferguson, "Art Sings the Blues," <I>The Washington Afro-American,</I> 26 Oct. 1991.</P>
<P>Frederick Brown's roots in his working-class neighborhood on Chicago's South Side contributed to his love of the Blues in the 1950s. Brown's father was friendly with many well-known Blues musicians, including Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, and Jimmy Reed lived in the neighborhood. Brown studied art and psychology at Southern Illinois University, where he earned his B.A. degree in art. He taught for several years in Chicago and Carbondale, Illinois, and traveled to Europe in 1969. In 1970 he moved to New York's SoHo district to become a professional painter, but supported himself by teaching part-time at the Brooklyn Museum, York College, and the School of the Visual Arts.</P>
<P>Brown's paintings of the early 1970s were large, bold abstractions based on the abstract expressionist tradition of the art department at Southern Illinois University. In 1975 Brown met the noted American painter, Willem de Kooning. De Kooning encouraged Brown and Brown still affectionately refers to de Kooning as his "artistic godfather." Brown's large gestural paintings attracted widespread attention and by the mid-1980s were exhibited at the prestigious Marlborough Gallery in New York.</P>
<P>By the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, Brown gradually included figural elements, a change that coincided with his creation of some landscape paintings reminiscent of folk art. An airplane motif also appeared in Brown's works—a motif that the artist says represents a marking of time.</P>
<P>In the mid-1980s Brown began a series of paintings that immortalized the friends, mentors, and colleagues who had exerted the greatest influence on his life. One of the first paintings in this series was a monumental <I>Last Supper,</I> completed in 1984, which portrays twelve men who had sustained Brown both personally and professionally. He painted several other religious subjects, including <I>John the Baptist,</I> <I>David and Goliath,</I> and <I>The Ascension.</I> In his portraits of this period, Brown attached photographs of his subjects' faces to the canvas to produce a collage effect. In addition to portraits of single figures, Brown painted large-scale canvases filled with numerous characters both real and fictional, often disparate in their references.</P>
<P>Brown's background and long-standing interest in the Blues logically led to the next phase of his career. Shortly after his arrival in New York in 1970, he had collaborated with jazz giants Ornette Coleman and Anthony Braxton on a variety of multimedia projects. As in Chicago, music has always been a part of Brown's New York environment. For Brown, music and painting are one, and the Blues provides the stimulus and inspiration for painting late at night when he feels at the height of his creative powers. After midnight, that's when the creative spirits are loose," Brown says.</P>
<P>Brown's meeting in 1969 with Chicago Bluesmen Earl Hooker and Magic Sam at a music festival in Denmark led to a suite of works twenty years later. Hooker and Magic Sam told Brown that they were more appreciated in Europe than in America, and Magic Sam predicted that after their deaths they would be quickly forgotten. Ironically, both men died shortly afterwards, and Brown vowed that he would do something to ensure that they would be remembered.</P>
<P>Two decades later, Brown felt ready to honor the pledge he had made in Denmark. He traveled to the Deep South to conduct research for a documentary on Blues singers. Since he had never spent any time in the South, he felt that it was important to visit the setting that gave birth to the Blues. Brown went to Clarksdale, Mississippi, where he visited the town's Delta Blues Museum. He talked with local Blues musicians and elderly black men who regaled him with stories about early Blues artists.</P>
<P>Returning to New York, Brown began a series of portraits of Blues musicians that he feels preserve the spirits of these artists. Like the best painters," he states, "those musicians had the ability to strike the universal heart chord."</P>
<P>Brown's most recent series of paintings, completed in 1991, were conceived when Brown visited his four-year-old daughter in a New York hospital. The hospital's drab interior motivated him to paint something that would make children laugh. The result is a series of large colorful paintings and original silkscreens of clowns. He hopes to reproduce some of the designs as tapestries, ceramics, or prints for children's hospitals.</P>
<P>In 1988 Brown had a retrospective exhibition at the National Museum of the Chinese Revolution at Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China. Brown currently lives in New York and also maintains a studio in Arizona.</P>

"5757","Artist Biography","<p>Known for creating this one painting, W. G. Williams may have been a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe. He painted his portrait of Dwight David and Mami Dowd Eisenhower [<I>President and Mrs. Eisenhower</I> 1989.78.1] several years after Eisenhower's election to the presidency in 1952. Although the artist was attentive to such personal details as the small hat and pearl earrings often worn by Mrs. Eisenhower, his choice of a religious setting for the couple seems curious. Neither President nor Mrs. Eisenhower was known to be especially religious. When the first couple joined the Presbyterian Church shortly after the inauguration in 1953, the church's pastor, against the President's expressed wishes, widely publicized the news. Williams may have been inspired by stories in the national press that mentioned the event. He surrounded his painting of the couple with collages of the Good Shepherd, the Holy Family, and Old Testament figures, suggesting a spiritual side of the peacetime president rather than his well-known military achievements.</p><p>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan <i>Made with Passion: The Hemphill Folk Art Collection in the National Museum of American Art</i> (Washington, D.C. and London: National Museum of American Art with the Smithsonian Institution Press, 1990)</p>",""

"5896","Artist Biography","<p>"To build a small palace around here with a Japanese carpenter in the finest traditions &#133;" is a dream George Nakashima would like to realize someday. "A palace in Japan is not an elaborate thing.&#133; It's actually fairly modest but beautifully done.&#133; It would be a great thing &#133; especially from the point of view of education." In a sense, the entire course of Nakashima's adult life has been shaped by his "personal reaction to architectural practice in this country," by this and his desire to improve design and craftsmanship.</p><p>Of Japanese descent, George Nakashima was born in Spokane, Washington in 1905. He studied Forestry and Architecture at the University of Washington, attended the Ecole Americaine des Beaux-Arts at Fontainebleau, and earned his Masters in Architecture from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1929. His love of wood and his instinctive feeling about the right way to handle materials led him to seek beyond his training as an architect. After graduating he went abroad, spending a year in France, then going to India and Japan where he worked with architects, woodworkers, and carpenters to learn their methods.</p><p>Returning to the United States in the early 1940s, Nakashima compared architectural practice here with the careful craft methods of Oriental building and decided architecture could not be his lifework. He resolved to "get into something that I could handle from beginning to end." Believing that design in architecture or furniture begins with materials and structure, and that design is proved in the making of a thing, he felt that as a builder of furniture he could maintain his standards of design and craftsmanship.</p><p>A long period of struggle followed that decision. Plans were interrupted by internment with his family in a World War II relocation center, but Nakashima refined his furniture-building techniques during this time by working with a carpenter who had been trained in Japan. In 1943 the family was released and moved to resettle in New Hope, Pennsylvania, where slowly he built his shop and home on several acres of hilly woodland.</p><p>In time his furniture attracted customers and by 1949 he was established as a designer and builder of fine, handcrafted furniture. He has never advertised nor sought publicity, yet demand for his furniture increased and his business grew to the twelve-workman shop he is responsible for today.</p><p>Nakashima places emphasis on the best use of a beautiful piece of wood in the simple forms which he evolved from both Japanese and early American tradition. His long apprenticeship and his deep reverence for wood are combined in the creation of timeless pieces of simplicity, pure line, and sensitive proportion. He works "from the characteristics of the material and methods of construction outwards, to produce an integrated and honest object."</p><p>Making a profit has never been a first consideration. Overriding every other intention is the feeling that "craftsmanship is not only a creative force, but a moral idea &#133; design is only something to realize a way of life." One aspect of this way of life is to give quality.

There, under his design and technical guidance, furniture related to each country and its craftsmanship is made, to be sold locally and abroad. Such projects as these, he hopes, will increase knowledge of fine woodworking methods in America and restore standards of craftsmanship being eroded in the Orient, for "if we can restore a little of &#133; fine concepts and attitudes and fine workmanship to Japan &#133; and if we can introduce the same thing here, I mean, it becomes rather universal.

Such space-filling patterns can also be found in the drawings of fellow Mexican-American artist Mart&iacute;n Ram&iacute;rez of California.</p><p>Am&eacute;zcua called her works "filigree drawings" because they reminded her of the Mexican-style filigree jewelry that she loved to wear.

Amezcua's drawings were often created simultaneously with original poems. The act of drawing helped shape the poems and occasionally inspired the creation of new poetry. As a child, Am&eacute;zcua began composing songs for herself, and her poetry can be seen as lyrics.

While in Munich, he associated with fellow art students Walter Ufer and Martin Hennings.  The year after his return (1914), Harrison sent him on a painting trip to New Mexico.  There Higgins found the strong light, brilliant color, and lure of the land a powerful antidote to the confines of academic training.  He joined the Taos Society of Artists in 1917, but he continued to divide his time between Chicago and Taos for some years and to exhibit in Indianapolis and New York, with an occasional painting sent to Europe.  As a link between his more conservative colleagues and the emerging artistic developments of the twentieth century, Higgins wedded theory to his own intuitively derived visual harmonies.

Her first job after graduating in 1950 was as a production potter, and that technical facility and experience were to be the foundation of her subsequent innovations. In 1952 Woodman traveled to Italy, where exposure to traditions such as majolica opened her eyes to the potential of clay.</p><p>It was not until the seventies that Woodman completely abandoned her functional approach. Collaborating with important figures in the Pattern and Decoration movement, such as Joyce Kozloff and Cynthia Carlson, she began producing colorful, witty&mdash;and nonfunctional&mdash;vessels decorated with scenes from the Italian Renaissance or slathered with landscape clouds. Woodman's eccentric shapes and glazes are often appropriated from other cultures; her work in a sense functions as a very personal interpretation of art history.

"6136","Artist Biography","<p>Thornton Dial, Sr., has worked as a laborer for most of his life in Alabama. He is the patriarch of an extended family in which the production of functional objects, primarily welded furniture, and artwork in diverse media became an integral part of family life as he neared retirement age during the mid-1980s. At the time, Dial explained his urge to make paintings, sculptures, and drawings: "Too many people died without ever getting their minds out to the world. I have found how to get my ideas out and I won't stop." Using a variety of industrial and salvaged materials, he creates powerful, richly textured narratives that present his views on issues as diverse as race relations, spirituality, the dynamic between men and women, and man's relationship to nature.</p><p>In 1992 the Los Angeles riots&mdash;the largest civil disturbance in American history&mdash;received massive television coverage, which Dial closely followed. <i>Top of the Line</i> [SAAM 1993.47] is one of two monumental paintings that convey his response to a key event in what he calls "the black odyssey." Here, densely interwoven and projecting forms evoke the melee of a mob and the act of looting, as rope-outlined figures shoulder or grasp at parts of air conditioners, refrigerators, and automobiles</p><p>In keeping with his role as a critic and interpreter, Dial's use of words is typically double-edged. The phrase, "top of the line," refers as much to the caliber of stolen merchandise as to the struggle for socioeconomic equality in contem-porary America. A play on the word "steal," the subtitle Steel derives from Dial's experiences in the steel town of Bessemer, Alabama. There he formed the belief that "the United States can't move without steel, the master. Negroes have worked with that stuff but they couldn't go to the top with it, couldn't participate in the big business. &#133;  Everybody wants the business. &#133; You want to take something over you got to take it quick."</p><p>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan <i>African-American Art: 19th and 20th-Century Selections</i> (brochure.

"6156","Artist Biography","<p>In the mid-1960s Dominic DiMare, a San Francisco Bay Area junior high school art instructor and self-taught, part-time studio weaver, was in the vanguard of American fiber art. Using a multiple harness loom, quadruple weaves (four panels woven together at a single point), and warp manipulation, he fashioned sculptural hangings from a variety of yarns, threads, and natural fibers&mdash;horsehair, uncarded wool, even grasses.</p>
<p>Off the loom, the weavings were often twisted, rolled, pleated, and further shaped by interweaving wires, or by tacking edges together. Unlike Lenore Tawney's more delicate and linear woven forms, DiMare's improvisational weavings from the 1960s are more substantial, and fiercely three-dimensional. Component forms include strips, medallions, shields, and manelike fringes, and his totemic designs, textured surfaces, and colors often revealed influences from primitive cultures.</p>
<p>Dominic DiMare grew up in Monterey, California, where his Sicilian-born father owned and operated a fishing boat. His youthful experiences as an ocean fisherman serve as his principal source of artistic inspiration. As a boy, he was enthralled by the sea, and fascinated by mariners' skills at knotting, splicing, binding, and braiding ropes, cords, and lines. At home, he routinely observed his father dexterously mend fishing lines and nets, and his mother crochet. Cruising a hundred miles or more off the coasts of California and Mexico in summer, he was deeply affected by the infinitude of ocean and sky, and mesmerized by the constant rhythm of ocean swells and the repeated movements of his fisherman father, The cruciform mast, knotted nets and lines, the drifting wake, and feathers and thread used to fashion fishing lures were to be keys to the formal construction and spiritual meanings of his later art.</p>
<p>In 1970 Dominic DiMare began handmaking rag papers. Often, the sheets incorporated flowers, plants, and feathers found on his Tiburon, California, property. Fie soon stopped weaving-even exhibiting&mdash;and instead concentrated on making increasingly metaphorical works from thick, handmade papers, and from found objects retrieved from the beach, yard, and roadside. The papermaking process-reaching into water to catch pulp, and creating bulky sheets that appeared like "frozen waves"&mdash;stirred deep-seated boyhood memories of ocean fishing, As a result, DiMare's intimate constructions of handmade papers and meticulously braided and knotted lines and threads are intensely, if elusively autobiographical. Process&mdash;repeatedly braiding and knotting, just as his father and Sicilian grandfather had done before him&mdash;is very much a part of the content and meaning of his work.</p>
<p><i>Manuscript #9</i> (1993.54.2) is from a series of twelve mixed-media constructions made in 1978 that employ a similar format. Each piece is composed of two or more layers of handmade paper suspended from a delicate frame of sanded hawthorns sticks. The foremost sheets contain a large, centralized cutout from which are hung alternating sheafs of smaller-sized paper and white, handmade felt. The name notwithstanding, there are no words to be found in the <i>Manuscripts.</i> Yet, each contains multiple levels of meaning, Instead of words, DiMare's sea-born mythology is expressed in miniature, netlike panels, tiny sparkling heads stitched in cross patterns, and trailing wakes of feathers and braided threads and raffia lines-along with faint embossings, and other impressions in the handmade paper.</p>
<p>DiMare prefers to work in series: "It forces you to explore and expand." Aside from the <i>Manuscripts,</i> there are <i>Temples, Shrines,</i> and <i>Altars;</i> the houselike <i>Domus</i> series; <i>Rune and Letter Bundles; TidalWands/Guides;</i> and the more recent, four-legged <i>Mourning Stations.</i> All are sacred structures&mdash;mysterious objects seemingly intended for unspecified rituals and ceremonies. Each symbolically expresses the artist's conviction that all individuals share traces of a common, ancient history, that combine&mdash;in varying degrees&mdash;the polarities of masculine <i>animus</i> and feminine <i>anima,</i> and have primitive needs for physical self-protection and spiritual survival.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

"6157","Artist Biography","<p>In 1954 Lenore Tawney abandoned sculpture for weaving and in the process, transformed the ancient craft of the weaver into a new vocation&mdash;fiber art. Following an intensely personal and experimental path, in the late 1950s Tawney created gauzy tapestries in which areas of plain weave were juxtaposed with laid in designs and large, transparent sections of loose, nonfunctional concept of weaving, her improvisational pieces appeared like freeflowing drawings made of colorful yarns floating in space.</p><p>Moving from Chicago to Manhattan in 1961, she became part of the avant-garde world of the abstract expressionists, and soon began to restructure her tapestries into sculptural 'woven forms.' These groundbreaking weavings dispensed entirely with a traditional rectangular format. In a startling departure from textile traditions, her tall, totemlike works were not set against a wall, but freely suspended in space. Often embellished with shells, beads, and fringes of feathers&mdash;and frequently composed of fibers of varying thickness and texture&mdash;these and other, smaller shieldlike designs woven in the 1960s, remained spiritually expressive, sculptural weavings.</p><p>In 1964 Lenore Tawney created the first of a profusion of collages and assemblages made from found objects. After 1976, when she abandoned weaving altogether, these nontextile works became the primary focus of her art. Small in scale, the pieces were fashioned principally from pages taken from rare books and manuscripts on whose age-stained surfaces were affixed fragile birds' eggs and skeletons, feathers, small animal bones, shells, pebbles, corks, and wooden forms. Like her weavings, Tawney' s miniature collages display great sensitivity to the aesthetic properties of materials, but unlike the bolder woven works, they are intimate and quiescent pieces, containing elusive messages about the frailty and transiency of life, and the need to find inner peace.</p><p>Lenore Tawney has long been attracted to mystical religious philosophies from both the East and West, and has imbued all her work with a deeply felt spiritual content. Through her weavings and other art forms, she wishes to encourage an attitude of communion and contemplation. Extensive global travels have exposed her to a multitude of ancient cultures and religious traditions&mdash;especially those of India. Yet, she accepts the Zen concept that all things are connected. and indeed, in its entirety. Her art can be seen as an ongoing spiritual quest to express that intangible truth.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

"6166","Artist Biography","<P>Sam Maloof is America's best known contemporary furniture craftsman. While he is self-taught as a woodworker, both his name and his work are instantly recognizable. No other twentieth-century studio furniture maker has received as many awards for design and craftsmanship. In 1985 he was named a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellow. He is the only craftsman to have received this coveted "genius" award.</P>
<P>Sam Maloof was born in 1916 in Chino, California, to Lebanese immigrant parents. He began making furniture in 1949, after working as a graphic artist in industry, serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, and working as a studio assistant to the artist-designer Millard Sheets, of Claremont, California. During the 1950s, he was a key member of the innovative, Los Angeles-area modern design movement; his work was included in the annual "California Design" shows, as well as other exhibits of contemporary-style home furnishings. With its warm tones, hand-sculpted details, and simple, timeless designs, Maloof's walnut furniture perfectly complemented the spare, open-plan interiors of the sleek, modernist Southern California residences built during that decade. Leading West Coast architects and decorators, as well as style-conscious homeowners, regularly ordered pieces from his small, one-man workshop, and his classic design attracted nationwide attention in the press.</P>
<P>In 1957 the American Craft Museum in New York launched its first exhibition of studio craft furniture, "Furniture by Craftsmen," and Maloof was invited to participate. The same year, he also attended the first national conference of the American Crafts Council (ACC) at Asilomar, California. As crafts gained popularity and credibility on both coasts, Sam discovered he was part of a thriving national movement. At Asilomar, participants discovered their shared dedication to working with their hands in an increasingly technological society. Maloof soon emerged as a leader; he served for a quarter century as an ACC trustee and during that time spoke and wrote tirelessly to promote the moral and spiritual values of handcraftsmanship. In 1969 he expressed his credo: "I want to be able to work a piece of wood into an object that contributes something beautiful and useful to our everyday living. To be able to work with materials without destroying their natural beauty and warmth, to be able to work as we want—that is a God-given privilege."</P>
<P>By 1970, Sam Maloof was acknowledged to be a leading member of the first generation of post-World War II studio furniture makers. These pioneers shared an aesthetic based on a modernist reverence for the beauty of solid hardwoods, a love of simple, sculptural shapes, a rejection of applied ornament and historical style, and above all, a dedication to function. Their influence remains strong among the postmodern "second generation" of studio furniture makers, even though this group employs mixed materials, creates personally expressive or historically based pieces, and often rejects function. For this generation, the quality of Maloof's work and the success of his business operation confirmed that woodworking was a viable way of life.</P>

"6274","Artist Biography","<p>In 1965 Adela Akers traveled to Peru as a weaving adviser to the Alliance for Progress Program. In South America, she was deeply influenced by the innovative textiles of pre-Columbian Peruvian weavers, and researched ancient fiber traditions. The following year, she set up a successful local cottage industry in the Yucatan employing native weavers, and helping to encourage the modern survival of an age-old fiber arts heritage. In her own work, she explored the early Indian weaving techniques she had studied in rural towns and villages. Like those of the ancient Peruvians, her tapestry forms incorporated subtle shaping and striping, slits, and tabs.</p>
<p>In the mid-1960s, Adela Akers also dramatically increased the scale of her woven hangings. The desire to enlarge her work and to use multiple units was stimulated by her interest in architecture, especially old buildings in her native Spain. "I look at walls as weaving"; she has explained; "I look at doors and doorways as slits." Increasing the size of her hangings also emphasized the internal structure of the piece: the elemental pattern of interlaced fibers was revealed more clearly. Beginning in the early 1970s, her work is marked by an increasing spareness of design, and the use of somber colors of similar value: brown, black, maroon.</p>
<p>After a summer spent researching basketry techniques at the Santa Barbara Museum in 1975, Akers continued her explorations in form and structure, using techniques of tapestry and twill, and ikat and soumak. The structure of the weave was of primary importance, and she emphasized it further by introducing jute and sisal to increase the physicality and stiffness of her pieces. To accentuate structure and textural contrasts even more, Akers restricted herself to fibers dyed a silver-gray: "gray was all the colors at once, and therefore no color."</p>
<p>Wall pieces from the late 1970s and early 1980s often are shaped constructions, monochromatic explorations of pure woven form that stretch the definitions of woven forms&mdash;works composed of sections of circles that drape like regular wave formations, compositions of long woven strips that, with pulled warps, suddenly curve out from the wall, or planar shapes that are arranged in fanlike formations.</p>
<p><i>By the Sea</i> (1993.54.1) marks a return to the use of strong color and color contrasts. Trips to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic exposed her to intense light and color, and to an exuberant Caribbean lifestyle that reminded Akers strongly of her childhood in Cuba. The clarity of the air and the brilliance of the water stimulated her to use strong color intervals in her work&mdash;and to introduce landscape imagery. "I grew up by water . . . sea and sky are inspiration to my work," Akers wrote in 1986; "the sea . . . becomes a reflecting surface, a mirror to the colors I see everywhere."</p>
<p><i>By the Sea</i> represents the reflection of colorful land formations in water. But instead of a single scene, the artist has interleaved two different and separately structured landscape views, each of which can only be seen clearly from opposite vantagepoints. The wall hanging is composed of thirty-two narrow strips joined together and arranged on the wall in an accordianlike plane. Each scene was woven on sets of sixteen strips. To construct the piece, Akers interconnected the two sets, placing a strip from one scene next to a strip from the other, and sewed them together. When viewed flat, <i>By the Sea</i> does not read as a landscape, but as a colorful abstraction. However, arranged as intended in an accordian fashion, the separate views are clearly visible from different angles.</p>
<p>From the left, mauve and turquoise headlands set against a nighttime sky are seen mirrored on a black sea. From the right, the scene is a daytime view, lit by a light gray sky. A single, purple horizon line unifies the blended views. But at each vertical join, there is a strong color contrast. Akers' affinity for structure and order is clearly evident in this woven form. As she has stated, "weaving combines structure and order, and offers me the best way to put together my visions."</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

"6275","Artist Biography","<P>Andrea Gill's decorated vases are functional forms that range into the realm of sculpture. While the artist adopts ideas, traditions, and styles of historical pottery, she turns them deftly around to question the very essence of the vessel form. Since 1980, when she began to work in clay full time, Gill has sought to camouflage, or to confuse the identity of her amphoralike pots by affixing winglike extrusions, or painting multiple images of vases, or other obscuring motifs on their surfaces.</P>
<P>Trained originally as a painter, and fascinated by the decorative techniques of Italian majolica painters, and folk artists in general, Andrea Gill has sought to contradict the three-dimensional form of her vessels by employing colorful, flat-patterned imagery. Surface decoration is essential to her work. In fact, Gill's vessels are primarily vehicles for painted decoration. Indeed, her more recent vases are covered with such dazzling pattern painting that it is often hard to distinguish the form beneath the surface decoration.</P>
<P>Gill begins by sketching on paper the outlines of a projected vessel. Contours are of special interest to her. "When you look at a pot," she writes; "most of the time you are looking at a line . . . even though you think of them as forms." She then hand builds the vessel according to the drawing using coils of terracotta, and bisque fires it. From this basic, often irregular shape, she produces a press mold from which numerous replicas can be made. The generic form of the molded vessel is then individually varied by adding slabs of clay. These winglike appendages become essential components in the painted decoration, for Gill treats her altered vessel form like an artist's shaped canvas.</P>
<P><I>Vase</I> (1993.54.4) is a tall pot wittily disguised by boldly painted leaf forms, several actually extruding from the surface. At first glance, the viewer fails to recognize the object as a vessel. The two-dimensional painted decoration is visually so arresting, it manipulates and hides the distinctive pot shape. Gill challenges the viewer to distinguish what is real and corporeal from what is imaginary, and flat.</P>
<P><I>Vase</I> clearly demonstrates Andrea Gill's talents as a painter. Following the painstaking and precise technique of a majolica decorator, she carefully paints over an opaque white glaze. But in her simple, flat-patterned design, she achieves the spontaneity, freshness and naivëte of the folk artist. The subject of this piece is also conceived in a humorous, folklike fashion. We know from experience that a vase is used to hold flowers. But, since this vessel is literally composed of botanical forms, the plants appear—contradictorily—to hold the pot.</P>

"6276","Artist Biography","<p>In 1973 Juan Hamilton, a trained ceramicist, settled in New Mexico, and for the next thirteen years served as studio assistant for the legendary painter Georgia O'Keeffe (1887&ndash;1986). During this extended period, Hamilton's own work in clay and bronze evolved into sculptural statements characterized by a mysterious, timeless order. Uniform or irregular spheres, ovoid as well as teardrop shapes, tall monoliths or flattened pebblelike forms, they suggest black rocks worn perfectly smooth over millennia by glaciers or running streams.</p>
<p>The smooth, curving contours of his primordial open or closed forms are based not only on Hamilton's early experience as a potter, or his knowledge of the works of sculptors Constantin Brancusi and Jean Arp. They are predicated on the indigenous skills and traditions of adobe building in New Mexico, which Hamilton patiently gained as he restored an old, abandoned house. The artist's elemental shapes also evoke the timeless eloquence of Japanese Zen gardens. During a trip to Japan in 1970, Hamilton's artistic vision was profoundly affected be his experience of the stillness, harmony, and spiritual peace of these meditative settings.</p>
<p>Resemblances and external influences notwithstanding, the shapes of Juan Hamilton's sculptures originate instinctively. "Certain forms just keep coming up, become part of my vocabulary. There's certainly some basis in natural forms, but they come from inside me. I feel them three-dimensionally, in the center of my chest. Some people see things but I feel them."</p>
<p><i>Juan 11-17-84</i> (1993.54.5) is a burnished bronze sculpture in the shape of a vessel. Like most of Hamilton's works in bronze, the spherical form began with the construction of an interior steel armature. This rigid framework is next covered by a steel mesh and sprayed with Fiberglas. After a lengthy process of filing and sanding, the shape and surface is finally perfected. The original form is then cast in bronze at a Colorado foundry.</p>
<p>The utter simplicity and smoothness of Hamilton's sculptures creates special casting and finishing problems: there is no exterior roughness to hide the welds that bind the individually cast sections. After further surface sanding, the outer shell of the bronze vessel was painstakingly finished with dozens of coats of water-sanded lacqueur and a final burnishing with polishing compounds. The smooth, dark, glistening surface is reminiscent of burnished Pueblo Indian pottery.</p>
<p>In its perfection of form and finish, <i>Juan 11-17-84</i> reveals Hamilton's complete dedication to craftsmanship. But, he writes, being a good technician doesn't make one a good artist: "I think the function of art is to focus people's attention, and that my role is as a visionary. [My] pieces are about mystery, about time and the effects of time, about the interior and exterior worlds&mdash;about a certain kind of purity, distillation."</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6277","Artist Biography","<p>Since 1969, Jun Kaneko has produced a large body of work in clay that exhibits his primary interest in the effects of repeated abstract surface motifs. Although he restricts his formal vocabulary to a limited number of free-standing sculptural shapes, and to wall-hung plates, the repetitive nature of his surface decoration nonetheless suggests an almost limitless range of visual effects. Kaneko feels compelled to embellish his work: "I almost always have a need to paint on it," he writes.</p>
<p>Using masking tape and colored slips, he covers his free-standing forms and wall-hung pieces with strong graphic motifs&mdash;lines, bars, polka dots, zig-zags, spirals, and other geometric markings. Originally trained as a painter in his native Japan, Kaneko is primarily concerned with pattern making, and repeats motifs and patterns to create visual order. The shape of each piece suggests its own particular decoration. "When I can hear what a form has to say," he states; "I start seeing marks and colors on the surface."</p>
<p>The large oval plate is one of Jun Kaneko's most persistent sculptural formats. Its slightly concave surface functions as a curved canvas on which, for years, the artist has developed infinitely variable arrangements of straight, curving, and spiraling lines. Along with wider bands, these narrow lines are painted in yellow, pink, aqua, burnt sienna, and black. The surface patterns of Kaneko's decorated plates reveal his essentially perceptual interests. Through color and texture&mdash;as well as alternating glossy and matte, smooth and textured surfaces&mdash;he creates a rich visual play of abstract imagery on a three-dimensional surface.</p>
<p>The lighter colored lines on Kaneko's plates naturally advance, while the darker ones recede. This optical effect creates the illusion of space. However, some lines are composed of more than one color, each with a different visual strength, which complicates the figure-ground relationship. Moreover, groups of lines often curve in contrasting directions, creating a rhythmic movement. In some cases, the colorful linear pattern is set against a dark monochrome field. In others, the background itself is composed of a dense pattern of shallow curving lines, alternately black and lighter-toned, glossy and matte.</p>
<p>The optical experience of Jun Kaneko's <i>Untitled</i> plates [1993.54.7 and 1993.54.8] is complex. Nonetheless, the overall visual effect is one of disciplined repose. By reducing his imagery to simple, archetypal symbols of nature, and minimizing the range of his colors, Jun Kaneko has created contemplative ceramic sculptures that celebrate universal aesthetic principles.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6278","Artist Biography","<p>Over four decades, John Mason has created a body of ceramic art noted for its increasingly conceptual and geometric nature. In the mid-1950s, as a student of Peter Voulkos in Los Angeles, he was an active participant in the aesthetic revolution that reshaped the field of American ceramics, transforming tradition-bound studio potters into avant-garde clay sculptors.</p>
<p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s Mason created towering, handbuilt clay sculptures and large ceramic wall reliefs whose monumentality and raw, gestural surfaces were comparable to abstract expressionist paintings. Increasingly, however, his wall-bound and vertical pieces became more massive and reductive, their surfaces smoother and less overtly expressive. A gradual shift toward a more geometric aesthetic occurred, and by the mid-1960s, centralized motifs of crosses and X shapes predominated.</p>
<p>By 1966 John Mason found the process of working directly with damp clay to create large monolithic pieces that required firing to be a handicap technically, and he began to question his very involvement with ceramics. In the early 1970s he abandoned clayworking altogether, and began instead to use commercially manufactured firebricks. Stacked and arranged in geometric formations, these modular units allowed him to create large scale, conceptual sculptures with a precision and speed impossible with traditional ceramic techniques. Moreover, the use of these industrial modules eliminated all traces of personal touch, resulting in anonymous, abstract works whose plans were predicated on elaborating simple ideas of symmetry&mdash;translation, rotation, and reflection.</p>
<p>In 1984 John Mason returned to making ceramic objects&mdash;vessels and plates, as well as free-standing triangles, squares, and rectangles. Modular forms often installed as ensembles, they were decorated with glazed geometric surface patterns that either accentuated or contradicted their elemental shapes. By 1986, however, the artist had isolated a particular format with which further to explore ideas of pure form&mdash;a large, four sided vessel whose geometric shape was given a distinctive contropposto, axial twist.</p>
<p><i>Vessel (86.4.P)</i> (1986) [1993.54.9] is one of an ongoing series of monumental "torque pots" exemplifying Mason's recent explorations in geometry and mathematics. Although the slab-sided walls of the massive, architectonic vessel are not aggressively twisted out of plumb like other examples in the series, the raised neck of the diamond-shaped pot has been twisted slightly out of true, and set deliberately at a contrasting angle to that of the pot. This double geometric distortion imbues the piece with a subtle, yet firm formal tension.</p>
<p>The surface of the dark-blue-glazed container is covered with a network of darker, raised lines that form a complex web of interlocking triangles. This design is directly related to a series of drawings made by Mason in 1986 that were based on mathematical relationships and geometric descriptions. There are actually two, interconnected and evolving diagrams that combine to form a larger, all-over pattern. The weblike lines describe three-dimensional, geometric bodies rotating in space, contradicting the planar and static nature of the vessel's physical form, and further infusing it with a visual tension.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6279","Artist Biography","<p>Ris&euml; Nagin's rectangular fabric constructions are often called "art quilts," but they are not restricted to developments within the field of textiles alone. Instead, the appliqu&eacute;d works are natural outgrowths from her prior training and ongoing interest in painting. The artist actually describes herself as "a painter who puts things together in a particular way." But by choosing silks, velvets, acetates, chiffons, cottons, and other dyed cloths&mdash;and incorporating metallic glitter and cellophane&mdash;Nagin is able to achieve visual effects beyond the scope of oil and acrylic paints. In her multitextile, layered compositions, she can actually create&mdash;rather than illusorily suggest&mdash;the transparency and luminescence that painters seek with glazes.</p>
<p>In 1977 Ris&euml; Nagin first began to superimpose layers of translucent fabrics to construct zones of luminous color. Subtleties in hue were further enhanced by washes of acrylic color brushed onto commercially dyed textiles. She also left areas in her compositions unlined to allow light to penetrate sheer fabrics. Training in papermaking also broadened her experience in materials and methods of construction, and in the early 1980s she began to employ stitching not simply as a technique, but as a strong graphic element in her designs.</p>
<p>Much of her work from the 1970s and early 1980s was made to be worn. Because its shape did not disrupt the flow of her designs, the kimono was a favored format. Decorative patterns were composed of abstracted images derived from trips along the Pennsylvania Turnpike&mdash;zig-zag tire treads, diagonal guardrails, truck grilles, directional arrows, and snatches of passing scenery. Since it wrapped around the body, the kimono, she argued, was like the cocoon of an automobile interior.</p>
<p>But not all of Nagin's works from the 1970s are wearable objects. Her award-winning <i>Night Swarm</i> (1979) [1993.54.11] is a "fabric painting" meant to hang on the wall. The central image is a landscape viewed through a window from inside a house. Elements include a composite image of a tree depicted, as in a cubist composition, from different angles, and a graphic impression of a swarm of flying insects&mdash;in this case a direct reference to a colony of bees that once swarmed outside Nagin's window, obscuring the light. The view from a domestic window is a poetic theme common to Romantic painting, but in <i>Night Swarm,</i> interior and exterior environments are not separate spaces, but meet commingled in a single zone.</p>
<p>In 1984 the direction of Nagin's art underwent a fundamental change. From ideas derived from sensory experience, the artist now turned to imagery&mdash;originating in her unconscious mind. With this dramatic shift in the character of her content, Nagin firmly adopted a rectangular, picturelike format for her appliqu&eacute;d compositions. Employing a personal iconography comprised of archetypal images drawn from many cultures&mdash;flat-patterned hands, house forms, skulls, snakes, and globular and cellular shapes&mdash;she created elusive pictorial tales that communicate the anxiety of disturbed dreams.</p>
<p><i>Illustrated Passage</i> (1988) [1993.54.10] is one of series of ambiguous compositions created in the mid to late 1980s that pictorially represent symbolic power struggles, both personal and universal in significance. Employing a limited number of repetitive images, these works portray perturbed states of mind. Summarizing her creative approach, Ris&euml; Nagin writes: "My intention is to create beautiful, complex surfaces which evoke some of the human experience. Perhaps it is something as simple as the quality of light or, in recent work, the use of symbolic narrative suggesting the intensity of inner realities."</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6280","Artist Biography","<p>In his eloquent fabric collages, Michael Olszewski communicates "intimate feelings prompted by people and circumstances." Using line, color, texture, and symbolic form, he expresses personal responses to such sorrowful human experiences as separation, aging, and death&mdash;and his own long struggles with self-identity. As a result, his art is solemn and emotionally serious. Yet, the somberness of meanings notwithstanding, his pleated and stitched pieces made from resist-dyed silks and other fabrics materially impart an extraordinary delicacy and gentleness. Modest in size, their intimate scale and softly blended, grayed colors help convey the elegaic nature of their subjects&mdash;the death of his father, the loss of friends to AIDS.</p>
<p>Olszweski's fabric constructions combine traditional batik and Japanese shibori resist-dyeing techniques with hand stitching and embroidery. The unobtrusive needlework creates linear and abstract markings on soft silk surfaces reminiscent of drawing and handwriting. The variable character of the stitching helps to establish the emotional tenor of works: small stitches suggest loneliness and desperation, while larger, more spacious ones impart a happier mood.</p>
<p>By employing pieced and appliqu&eacute;d textiles&mdash;both old and new&mdash;the artist firmly evokes the history of quilt-making and textiles that record the lives of individuals and peoples. But the influences on his art are more diverse than those within the history of textiles. They include the nonobjective paintings of the Russian constructivists, the rich, colorful abstractions of Sonia Delaunay, Marsden Hartley, and Mark Rothko, and the abstract expressionist painters' direct use of color, form, and texture.</p>
<p><i>Speaking to Hear</i> (1989) [1993.54.12a-b] is a separately framed diptych. The artist employs this particular format to tell two sides of a story, to convey the idea of different viewpoints in a narrative. In this instance, the subject is about interpersonal communication&mdash;about the difficulty, sometimes, of speaking those words that another person needs so much to hear. The compositions are similar: a wider band is placed over a panel of narrower strips, and set against a grayed backdrop of pleated, resist-dyed silk. To convey the duality of viewpoints, the two geometric images are reversed.</p>
<p>Seen on the left, the vertical band represents the sternum, the center of a ribcage. The strips, like equal signs, anchor the image, and the resulting cruciform embodies symbolically the center of a person&mdash;in this case the artist. Although the composition is turned on its side, the right hand work is similarly structured, and the various additional components balance those that appear in the opposite work. Initially, the viewer perceives only the strong, central cruciform shape, but then, as he examines the works in greater detail, extra pieced elements and stitchery on the pleated backgrounds are noted.</p>
<p>The silk pleating common to <i>Speaking to Hear</i> and other fabric constructions by Olszewski was inaugurated in 1979. At the time, the artist was writing a letter on a legal-sized pad of lined paper and having difficulty conveying his thoughts. In order to pursue the notion of personal communication further in his fabric works, Olszewski introduced pleats to suggest lined paper, and used stitching as writing.</p>
<p>In <i>Speaking to Hear,</i> black stitches and dense embroidery sections appear and disappear against the variegated tones of the gray silk like whispered words, and the colors of the pieced fabrics communicate the mournful mood of the intended conversation. The varied reds of the bands and stripes infuse a poignancy and urgency into the need for speaking and hearing, while the quiet grays, with their pulsating tonal gradations, inject a note of sadness.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6281","Artist Biography","<p>Marjorie Schick's work is rooted in the European jewelry revolution of the 1960s when innovators, rejecting the traditional materials, techniques, and social meanings of Western jewelry, began to employ the entire human frame&mdash;not just a finger, neck, or wrist&mdash;as a point of artistic departure. Schick herself views the body as a "living sculpture," and, using painted wooden dowels and other ordinary materials, constructs additional sculptures with which to adorn it.</p>
<p>Since the body can support large objects&mdash;both physically and visually&mdash;Schick often fabricates works whose size is startling: a brooch that extends far beyond the wearer's shoulder, animating the surrounding space; a necklace so large it creates its own physical environment; a piece worn on the shoulders that encases the entire head, framing or bisecting the face. Although each construction is designed for placement on the body, her works nonetheless function as independent sculptural statements.</p>
<p>Marjorie Schick's jewelry is equally based on the traditions of twentieth-century abstract art&mdash;in particular, constructivism. So strong is the relationship with fine art, her sculptural pieces have been described as abstract art with its roots in jewelry. The artist writes: "there are four major aspects to my work: the constructed, three-dimensional form; the color relationships; the definition of space; and the scale of the objects in relationship to the human figure." Her principle goal, she states, is to create a "visual tension" among the formal elements of her bright, skeletal constructions.</p>
<p>A powerful, tensile energy results from the dynamic manner in which she arranges bright colors, lines of different length, and sharp angles of intersection. Schick refers to these colorful linear constructions as "three-dimensional drawings to wear." Instead of marking lines and colors on a surface, she creates her three-dimensional "stick" drawings for spaces that exist at the boundaries of the head, torso, and limbs.</p>
<p><i>Neckpiece</i> (1986) [1993.54.13] is designed to be placed over the head and rest on the shoulders. The complex of dazzling lines thus visually segment the wearer's head, energizing the immediate spatial field where the body and jewelry interact. The dazzling sequence of dots and intersecting lines of vivid color are seen not only from the outside by the viewer, but at the same time, experienced from "inside" be the wearer. A lively tension between subject and object, and figure and ground is produced&mdash;a tension that is key to understanding Schick's work as a whole.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6282","Artist Biography","<p>Lizbeth Stewart's larger-than-life-size, hand-built ceramic sculptures of dogs, cars, lizards, and monkeys are imbued with an extraordinary, yet disconcerting preternaturalism. Viewers respond immediately and instinctively to the physical and psychological presence of these creatures. Technically, they are dazzling <i>trompe l'oeil</i> productions, and as a result of their astonishing realism, disbelief is willingly&mdash;if only momentarily&mdash;suspended.</p>
<p>"I want my animals to feel alive," the artist states. And indeed, heads, torsos, limbs, and feet are fabricated with such accuracy the ceramic forms appear animate. Hard, smooth skin seems to be stretched over soft flesh, and every bulge, or told appears directly linked to musculo-skeletal action. Poses and gestures are also so naturalistic, that one imagines the stationary creatures actually are poised for action. Since there is always more than one animal or object in a ceramic composition, a narrative is suggested. What, we ask, will happen next?</p>
<p>On closer examination, faces and surface decoration confound first impressions. Initial projections of sentimental feelings onto pets and zoo creatures vanish. What at first appeared to be familiar and domesticated, turns out to be alien and psychologically stressful. Painted, anxious eyes stare fixedly into the distance, seemingly alerted by sounds or movement beyond human apprehension that signal territorial intrusions. In fact, the artist says she is attracted to pets and wild animals precisely because of their "intuitive understanding of the world we pay so little attention to."</p>
<p>In sculptures dating from the late 1980s ceramic bodies are often decorated in an anti-naturalistic fashion. Instead of simulating hide and skin, Stewart paints patterns of stripes, curves, and swirls on her animals. In some cases, there is a simulacrum of truth: wavy lines suggest hair; ring patterns around eyes seem real enough; and facial markings&mdash;especially of monkeys&mdash;appear, at least to the uninitiated, to be within the realm of possibility. Yet, in other examples, the surface painting is purely arbitrary: bodies function as canvases for bold decoration.</p>
<p>Colors, too, are expressionistic, rather than naturalistic. Stewart enlivens her gun-metal-gray monkeys with vivid china paints&mdash;patterns of yellows, blues, white, and orange. As a result, there is a disruptive tension between the genuine appearance of the bodily form and its often irrational decoration. But it is this very disruption of the normative flow of perception and comprehension, and the raising of unanswerable questions, that lifts Lizbeth Stewart's animal sculptures into the surreal realm of art.</p>
<p><i>Monkey and Lizard</i> (1989) [1993.54.16] is an outstanding example of Lizbeth Stewart's figurative ceramic sculpture. In this large work, as in her other compositions, the simian is juxtaposed provocatively with another
object&mdash;in this case, a lizard. The content and meaning of the suggested narrative is enigmatic, and open to a broad range of subjective interpretation. In this respect, her ceramic scenarios are akin to the fantastic beasts in the na&iuml;ve jungle paintings of Henri Rousseau. Since they are so close to humans on the evolutionary scale, monkeys are often disturbing creatures, sometimes provoking deep-seated anxieties. In this instance, the tension of the distorted pose, the troubled look, and the sensitive, humanlike hands and prehensile feet are emotionally unsettling.</p>
<p>But by conjoining two unlikely companions, locating them in an unnatural context, and decorating them expressionistically, the artist invites viewers to experience her subjects in an unconventional fashion. As a result, we are compelled to confront our sentimental ideas, feelings, and expectations about them, and recognize the distinctions between human and animal intelligence and instinct. "Animals were among some of the first images created by man," the artist writes; "to me they continue to express the magic of invitation. Rather than nature observed, my pets are both reasoning and instinctual creatures guarding their domain."</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6283","Artist Biography","<p>A leading member of the contemporary "art quilt" movement, Pamela Studstill's geometric, pieced fabric constructions are fields of dazzling color. Originally trained as a painter, the artist deftly combines traditional quilt-making techniques with modern scientific color and design theory to create intricate patterns whose vibrant, multihued, and evolving geometries produce a shimmering effect. "I like all that pattern," she says; "I like the way it moves. ... That shimmering quality is the mark of a successful quilt."</p>
<p>Fascinated by impressionist and neo-impressionist painting methods, the optical mixture of divided color, and the color theories of Johannes Itten, Hans Hofmann, and Josef Albers, Studstill brushes columns of dots, curved and wavy lines, and bricklike strokes of acrylic paint on small squares of opposing solid-color cottons. She is not unique among studio-quilt artists in adding pigments, but few have developed such a rigorous and effective approach. "By painting on my fabrics," she states; "I achieve a greater range of color and pattern than would be possible by using just solid-colored fabrics."</p>
<p>Studstill begins a quilt by creating a detailed drawing of the complicated patchwork design on graph paper. This underlying grid is an essential ordering device. It provides both an explicit and implicit structural framework on which to elaborate shifting relationships among shapes, hues, and values. The quilts themselves are composed of a profusion of small squares and rectangular strips of cloth, usually two to four inches in dimension&mdash;but sometimes as small as a postage stamp.</p>
<p>Once the design is finalized, and the drawing color-coded, Studstill cuts out the individual pieces as required from supplies of commercially dyed cottons. Some of the colored patches are then painted with contrasting hues to create a colorful random pattern within a pattern. But before being machine-sewn together, the individual blocks of cloth are first pinned to the wall so that the subtle chromatic and tonal gradations that are the essence of Studstill's art can be gauged precisely.</p>
<p><i>Quilt #17</i> (1982) [1993.54.17] is an early example of Studstill's distinctive amalgam of pattern painting and quilt-making, and reveals her extraordinary skills as a colorist and pattern maker. The quilt is numbered, not titled&mdash; "I don't want people to think about 'things' when they look at the quilts," the artist states&mdash;and the quilts now number more than one hundred and seven.</p>
<p>Even though the individual fabric components vary in size and shape, <i>Quilt #17</i>&mdash;like all of Pamela Studstill's patchworks&mdash;has a tessellated, or mosaiclike appearance. Repetition of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal strips, and squares and rectangles help structure the intricate, five-by-five-foot composition. But the artist deliberately undermines methodical order by arbitrarily varying the arrangement of her pieced shapes. As a result, the geometric composition collapses into a delightful riot of color.</p>
<p>As the eye moves from top to bottom, <i>Quilt #17</i> undergoes a subtle but definitive transformation in color and light. Gradually, almost imperceptibly, lighter color values change into darker ones. "Each of my quilts," the artist writes; "is a study in light." Surface paint helps ease the transition from one color to another. In scientific terms, such a progressive, step-by-step alteration is known as a parquet deformation. But in Studstill's case, the principle of incrementally graduating tones was not soley based on scientific or color theory, but also intuited from the experience of her Texas Hill Country surroundings. "I am inspired," she writes; "by landscape views and vistas, fields of [all kinds] ... and changes in my local landscape."</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6284","Artist Biography","<p>During the 1950s and 1960s, functional potter Robert Turner helped develop and refine a stoneware aesthetic that was synonymous with American ceramics of the era. His high-fired, reduction wares were classics of their kind. Timeless and universal in shape, they had gradually evolved, first from a careful study and testing of vessel forms derived from ancient China and Greece, and then, in the 1950s, under aesthetic influences from Japanese folk pottery and Zen Buddhism, the Bauhaus, and contemporary Scandinavian ceramics. The simple, elegant forms of his wheel-thrown casseroles, vases, bowls, and covered jars were based on straight lines that were modified only sparingly by sweeping curves. Each refined and disciplined form was superbly fitted to its primary function&mdash;cooking, holding, pouring.</p>
<p>By the late 1960s, however, Turner's pottery had reached a such degree of perfection in both form and expression that he perceived it as a "dead end." At mid-career, feeling he had exhausted his original reasons for vessel making, he began to experiment. Building on the formal transformations of potter Peter Voulkos, he began to reconfigure the essential geometry of the pot. With form no longer following function, Turner became one of the leading makers of organically abstract "art" pots during the 1970s.</p>
<p>In 1971&ndash;72, drawn by the power of African sculpture, and wishing to imbue his work with a greater sense of universality, Robert Turner traveled to Nigeria and Ghana. The trip proved transformational. In West Africa he was deeply moved by the way in which art was ingrained in daily experience, and by the beauty of traditional forms of architecture, pottery, ceremonial objects, and decoration. After his return, Turner began to produce series of distinctive vessel types named after African kingdoms and peoples&mdash;Ashanti, Ife, Oshogbo, Akan. The first is a squat, lidded pot; the others are cone and cylinder shapes.</p>
<p>In these variations on formal themes, he endeavored to express his perception of the cultural spirit of the various tribal centers he had visited, as well as evoking the shape, color, and texture of the local landscape. The canyons, desert landscape, and adobe architecture of the American Southwest also deeply attracted Turner's attention at this time, resulting in his ongoing series of de Chelly vessels&mdash;a fourth cone and cylinder variant.</p>
<p>Limiting his formal vocabulary in the 1970s and 1980s to a handful of distinctive cone and cylinder shapes inspired by his African sojourn, Turner also restricted the colors and his clays and glazes to three basic hues: blue-black, red-brown, and tones of white. The outsides of his pots were often sandblasted to create chromatic variations and more inviting and tactile surfaces.</p>
<p><i>Akan</i> (1984) [1993.54.20] exemplifies Robert Turner's mingling of influences from his experiences in West Africa. Peter Voulkos' ceramics, and his own decades-long interest in reworking and refining the essential geometry of the vessel. Like his other types of pots, this dark-toned <i>Akan</i> is composed of two elementary, wheel-thrown shapes&mdash;a wide-based cone that firmly supports a cylinder.</p>
<p>The generalized form serves as the armature for rectangular strips of clay that look like steel bars that Turner juxtaposes on its surface. Along with other surface additions, these strips are placed in such a way as to suggest movement both up and around the sculptural pot. In the artist's words, the added strips "begin to move as a structure, as in a dance, spanning space like a bridge&mdash;almost as though I could take the pot away and they could exist by themselves."</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""
"6285","Artist Biography","<p>In 1973 ceramicist Paula Winokur traveled for the first time to the American West. The trip by air literally changed her point of view&mdash;toward the landscape and human actions that alter the face of nature. During the 1980s, she became increasingly fascinated by the remains of past civilizations, either as artifacts, or as marks on the face of the earth.</p>
<p><i>Mantel for Three Bowls</i> [1993.54.22] is one of a series of porcelain wall pieces incorporating ledgelike forms affixed to vertical planes. These works strongly suggest the geology of Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado, a rock-ribbed, desert landscape that deeply moved the artist. In this vast and austere setting, Winokur experienced a physical immensity and sense of timelessness that strongly influenced her subsequent work. On the mesa, she felt, as an almost palpable presence, the spirit of the Anasazi&mdash;the ancient Pueblo culture that once thrived in the region. She was fascinated and awed by the appearance of window openings and niches in the sheer cliffs, and long-abandoned, lean-made forms balanced precariously on canyon ledges.</p>
<p>The rough-edged ledge and canyon-like wall of <i>Mantel for Three Bowls</i> evoke the vast scale and appearance of the stark Mesa Verde landscape. The various drawings and incisions on the porcelain surfaces, on the other hand, are suggestive generally of the ways in which past civilizations have imprinted their presence on the earth's surface, either through pictographs, pathways, irrigation canals, or agriculture. Often, this material evidence can be seen only from high above, and the long incisions on Winokur's porcelain surfaces evoke the immensity experienced only from an aerial viewpoint.</p>
<p>Yet, the appearance of the three decorated vessels on the mantel-like shelf suddenly introduces an entirely different set of dimensions. The intimate scale of the cups contrasts sharply with the vastness suggested by the landscape-like ledge and wall. There is a startling, surreal quality to the juxtaposition. On one hand, the cups can be read as monumental forms in a landscape setting, but on another, they can be understood as archeological artifacts, domestic utensils scaled for the human hand. Read simply as ceramic vessels, they collapse the apparent immensity of their geological environment into a miniature setting. What was read as a sandstone ledge becomes, in fact, the shelf of a mantelpiece. But restore the ledge to its imaginary, landscape scale, and the cups suddenly expand into immense forms. It is this shift between the monumental and the diminutive which gives Paula Winokur's work a special appeal.</p><p>Jeremy Adamson <i>KPMG Peat Marwick Collection of American Craft: A Gift to the Renwick Gallery</i> (Washington, D.C.: Renwick Gallery, National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, 1994)</p>",""

Lee-Smith concedes, "In my case, aloneness, I think, has stemmed from the fact that I'm black. Unconsciously it has a lot to do with a sense of alienation." Although his feelings about racial inequities or disharmonies have been inspirational, he seeks to create images that articulate his emotions about social and cultural disparity as it relates to all of humanity.

"My feelings and emotions [about the painting] are different today, but it is from my brush and my soul," he says.

Constructed of wood, fur, cloth, and other materials, the minkisi bundles held medicines and other concoctions and were considered powerful mystical receptacles. However, when Stout later attended Carnegie-Mellon University, she pursued realist painting in the style of Edward Hopper and Richard Estes rather than exploring her African-American heritage in her art. Stout soon realized that her street scenes, devoid of people, were more like portraits of houses, which led her to consider the concept of house as home of the spirit, container of memories and dreams, and, by extension, a symbol of human activity and aspiration.</p><p>After graduating from Carnegie-Mellon in 1980, Stout moved to Washington, D.C., where she began developing a unique form of Kongo-inspired sculpture.

"6593","Artist Biography","<p>James VanDerZee is one of the country's most distinctive portrait photographers. From his first experiments with a small box camera around the age of fourteen, his interest continued as he photographed friends and family in Massachusetts, New York, and Virginia for pleasure and occasional commissions. Settling in New York City around 1909, he secured a job as a "darkroom man" for a photographer's small department store concession. In 1916, he chose photography over a less lucrative career as a musician and opened his first studio on West 135th Street.</p><p>During the next forty years, VanDerZee chronicled the people and celebrations of Harlem&mdash;from schoolchildren, church groups, and wedding couples, to the parades organized by black nationalist Marcus Garvey and the funeral for singer Florence Mills. The exhibition, Harlem on My Mind, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1969, brought his work to the attention of the art world, to which he had paid little notice. Ironically, he had retired that year because of a declining market for his particular form of portraiture and the advent of cheaper, easier-to-use cameras. Three years before his death, however, VanDerZee resumed photography.</p><p><i>Evening Attire</i> [SAAM, 1994.57.3] epitomizes VanDerZee's considered approach to studio portraiture. The young woman is carefully placed between two tables, against a painted background. The details of her dress, the illusionistic backdrop, tiled floor, and patterned tablecloth create an abundance of texture and tone. Her gaze seems dreamy, an effect enhanced by the softly focused edges of the image.</p><p>VanDerZee strove to capture the personality, character, and intrinsic beauty of his sitters. His photographs are not simply documents, but celebrations of Harlem lives that included some degree of affluence and an appreciation of small luxuries&mdash;a beaded dress, a fur stole, an attentively decorated home. Here was an opportunity for African Americans to see themselves as the center of a universe, as white Americans could in mainstream society. For VanDerZee, this was reflected in the careful framing of a world of elegance, refinement, and a beauty sometimes elusive in the world outside his studio.</p><p>Lynda Roscoe Hartigan <i>African-American Art: 19th and 20th-Century Selections</i> (brochure.

Brady was impressed by Gardner's expertise with the difficult wet-plate negative/paperprint process, which was rapidly displacing the daguerreotype in America.  In 1858 Garnder moved to Washington, D.C., to manage Brady's gallery there.  For a short time he was part of Brady's team of Civil War photographers, but in a disagreement over attribution of his work (Brady published all pictures taken by his staff as the work of Brady & Co.), Gardner left to establish his own business photographing the war.  In 1866 he published <i>Gardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War,</i> a two volume work with text and one hundred images taken by himself and several other photographers, including Timothy O'Sullivan and John Reekie, whos images are meticulously credited.</p><p><i>Burnside Bridge, Across Antietam Creek, Maryland</i> shows the site of some of the most desperate fighting during the Battle of Antietam.

In fact, the picture was taken sometime after the battle.  Documenting a landscape that hides a cemetery, the photographer shows a bridge &#8212;  "the only monument of many gallant men who sleep in the meadow at its side."</p><p>Merry A.

"6751","Artist Biography","<p>According to an advertisement in the Norristown, Pennsylvania, <i>Register,</i> Stroud&mdash;the town's first resident photographer&mdash;opened his daguerreotype studio on September 3, 1850.  His advertisements urged clients to "call as early in the day as possible &#133; avoid [wearing] light blue, or too much WHITE."  Stroud's business soon expanded to include other photographic processes, including paper prints made from negatives.  The ability to make many copies of an image quickly eclipsed the popularity of the unique daguerreotype, and studios like Stroud's did a brisk business reproducing the older images.  As in early daguerreotpes, color was delicately applied to the surface of the finished photograph.</p><p>A note on the back of this portrait indicates it was made after a daguerreotype by the important Philadelphia studio of William and Frederick Langenheim.  Curiously, it was the Langenheim brothers who purchased the American patent rights to the paper process from its British inventor, William Henry Fox Talbot.

"6847","Artist Biography","<p>Viramontes was born in 1943 in Richmond, California, and received a B.F.A. from San Francisco Art Institute and an M.A. from San Francisco State University. He was one of several artists and community activists who helped establish the Galeria de la Raza in San Francisco in order to exhibit art by Chicano and Mexican artists. As part of the Galeria's educational outreach program he painted several temporary, billboard-sized murals with such diverse topics as encouraging the community to keep its neighborhoods clean and discouraging children from eating junk food. The poster <I>Boycott Grapes</I> was commissioned by the Galeria de la Raza's founding director, Rene Ya&#241;ez, to help support the work of the United Farm Worker's Union. Viramontes printed about twenty-five serigraphic impressions of the image and then gave the color separations to the UFW for offset lithography. When asked about political posters as an artistic medium, Viramontes wrote: "For making political statements, one can never underestimate the powers of a poster. A strong, well-executed image with a few chosen words can make a great impact and can outlive the memories of past rallies or political marches." The recipient of numerous printmaking awards, Viramontes has taught classes in etching, monoprint, linocut, and silkscreen techniques at City College in San Francisco since 1980. He is the chairman of the Fort Mason Campus Gallery, which showcases City College student work.</p><p>Therese Thau Heyman <i>Posters American Style</i> (New York and Washington, D.C.: Harry N.

"6976","Artist Biography","<p>Bufford was the first employer and art teacher of Winslow Homer, but was also a prolific lithographer and competitor of Nathaniel Currier. Homer's fame as an artist and Currier's successful publishing firm, which became Currier and Ives, overshadow Bufford's legacy as a commercial illustrator of books and sheet music. Nevertheless, he was a popular and successful artist in his day. He also made drawings of disasters, a precursor to the newspaper photograph. Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Bufford apprenticed in Boston and, by 1835, moved to New York, where he opened a lithography business. By 1840, he had returned to Boston and formed a partnership with his brother-in-law in a new lithographic printing firm, for which he did most of the drawing. The business, with and without his brother-in-law as partner, thrived until the late 1860s, when photolithography became a widely available, less expensive alternative. As an engraver, Bufford was dedicated to replicating faithfully the work of other artists. His own work after 1840, however, took on a sketchy, shorthand duality. With tastes already beginning to shift toward a photographic naturalism, he gradually withdrew from the drafting side of his business and hired younger artists to carry on in his place.</p><p>William H.

"7036","Artist Biography","<p>One of the finest homes in Brattleboro, Vermont, Blake Block was built as a residence in 1810.  For many years it was the home of John W. Blake, one of Vermont's foremost lawyers, and of Blake's eldest son, John R. Blake.  Also an important figure in Brattleboro's history, the younger Blake was a businessman who was influential in promoting the contruction of the Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad, which connected Brattleboro with Boston, furthering Vermont's trade and tourism.  Perhaps because it was on the main street of a bustling village, the house was transformed into a commercial building in 1853, housing the village druggists, grocers, librarian, and booksellers.</p><p>October 1869 was a disastrous month for the city of Brattleboro.  Unseasonable flooding tore away bridges and destroyed underground cisterns.  Weeks later, when a fire in a saloon could not be contained, the buildings on a large part of Main Street, including the commercial property known as Blake Block, were destroyed.</p><p>The identity of the person who photographed Blake Block before the fire is unknown; at that time Brattleboro had many local photographers.  Caleb Lysander Howe's stereocard, made after the fire, was probably produced to be sold in a set of town views.  Typical of many nineteenth-century photographers, Howe found his trade by chance rather than design.  A farmer and music teacher, he became fascinated with the medium when an itinerant photographer set up a temporary studio near the Howe family farm in 1852.  Howe offered to buy him out for three hundred dollars and, thus equipped, launched a new career that was profitable enough to become a family business.</p><p>Merry A.

With the widespread  destruction of livestock during the Civil  War, the corn harvests shifted from feed  to whiskey, which required enormous  quantities of stoneware for its storage and  sale. Potters of eastern Crawford County,  such as the Bechams, specialized in liquor jugs, which were sold as fast as they could  be made. Wash's sons, Fate and Jack,  continued the family tradition until Prohibition curtailed the demand for jugs.

Holzapfel's father was a machinist who designed and built the first lathe she used for turning the table legs of her husband's furniture.  The process of turning the lathe seemed natural to Holzapfel, so she continued turning wooden vessels and objects, a primarily self-taught venture, for twenty years.</p><p>Despite the fact that she turns wood, Holzapfel maintains that she is not a vessel maker.  She uses wood-lathe turning in conjunction with carving to create visually compelling and tactilely inviting sculptural forms.

"7244","Artist Biography","<p>Art Chantry has been making posters since he was fifteen. Among his influences are many forms of "outsider art," such as monster magazines, hot-rod art, and psychedelic culture. He found much inspiration for innovative graphic ideas in an article on Polish posters.</p><p>Chantry's sense of design relates to the punk scene in Seattle as he finds himself, with the avant-garde, creating posters for local rock concerts. Chantry has championed what he considers to be the "subculture" of design, a neglected commercial usage of the industrial trade seen in the tool catalogs of the 1940s and 50s.</p><p>Born in Seattle and raised in Tacoma, Chantry received what he describes as "a very potent taste of what it's like to be poor in a single-parent family." Chantry attended college in Bellingham, Washington. He graduated with a degree in painting but turned to the graphic work that had been his livelihood through his school years. In a curious way, Chantry's ability to look for and reinvent the out-of-fashion, the purposely outside the mainstream international style, has resulted in his being selected for many exhibition and design magazines. Even with the recognition of his peers, he chooses to remain an outsider, often rejecting work with commercial corporate clients for commissions that allow him to remain on the fringe. As he is now the art director of an alternative Seattle paper, he has the advantage of economic stability with the luxury of working only on projects that interest him.</p><p>Therese Thau Heyman <i>Posters American Style</i> (New York and Washington, D.C.: Harry N.

"7279","Artist Biography","<P>Frederick Carl Frieseke was born in Owosso, Michigan, and after brief study at the Art Institute of Chicago he moved to Paris in 1898, where he worked with several academic painters. After 1900 he adopted the light, colorful palette of the impressionists but never abjured the strong linear tradition of American art. He became the leading figure of the second generation of Americans at Giverny and acquired the house next door to Monet, which had been recently vacated by Theodore Robinson. But he seems never to have become a familiar to the elderly impressionist master, nor to have patterned his work after him. He acknowledged the dominant influence of Renoir, and the generously proportioned figures in his paintings often resemble those of Renoir.</P>
<P>He remained committed to female subject matter throughout his career, favoring the depiction of nudes surrounded by flowers and bathed in dappled sunlight. "It is sunshine," he wrote, "flowers in sunshine, girls in sunshine, the nude in sunshine, which I have been principally interested in." Often he would add parasols or other geometric figures for contrast with the broken color areas of flowers.</P>
<P>He remained throughout his life an unapologetic expatriate. In France, he said, "I am more free and there are not the Puritanical restrictions which prevail in America—here I can paint the nude out of doors." Some of his most sensitive works, however, were interiors of subjects posed in elegant environments engaged in intimate occupations.</P>
<P>It would be interesting to compare the self-consciously decorative quality of his nude studies to the angular frankness of Degas' late bathers pastels. Despite the evident skill in Frieseke's paintings, they have not escaped criticism. One prominent observer described them as sentimental "confections" characterized by their "sweet and sugary" coloration.</P>

In 1910 he quit high school to study art full-time at the National Academy School, but later that same year transferred to the Art Students League.

Rockwell's posters, while not as numerous as his magazine illustrations, were done for a wide variety of organizations and issues. Early in his career, in the 1920s and 1930s, he made posters for products such as Coca-Cola and Maxwell House coffee. His movie posters include those for <I>Along Came Jones</I> (1945), <I>The Razor's Edge</I> (1946), and <I>Stagecoach</I> (1966).

"7321","Artist Biography","<P>The approach to Rockwell's home in Arlington, Vermont, where he lived from 1939 until he moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts, was accented by a covered bridge built in 1852. Thus, a rural past, and the emblems of small-town life that appear in many of his paintings, were never far from his easel. In fact, his Arlington neighbors posed for <I>Freedom of Speech,</I> the best known of his "Four Freedoms" paintings. Knowing this, one might assume that Rockwell's New England paintings are close copies of life in Arlington (or Stockbridge), but that was not the case. Rockwell was, as his many self-portraits reveal, a great believer in deception. With unerring skill, he recast major national events to play on a traditional small-town stage, thus toning down the more disturbing aspects of the depression, World War II, rapid urbanization, integration, and the numerous social changes that followed. But that enabled Rockwell, who saw himself as an illustrator, to address a much wider audience.</P>
<P>Born in New York, into a family that could offer him little support, Rockwell left high school in his sophomore year to enroll at the Art Students League.

Prang's chromolithographic process&mdash;reproduction in oil colors&mdash;brought color-printed advertising into common use and pictures of old New England into a wide range of American homes. He set high standards for his reproductions, insisting on color and textural quality that duplicated the original image.

During six months spent traveling in Central and South America in 1976, he studied pre-Columbian art, including pottery, textiles, stone carving, and metalsmithing. While he was a student, Mitchell had served as technical assistant to wood sculptor J. B. Blunk in Inverness, California, working on numerous public and private commissions from 1969 to 1977. The technical and aesthetic aspects of this experience with Blunk influenced his own work in wood turning, which he began teaching himself in 1977. Participation in several invitational national wood-turning symposia provided Mitchell with additional training in 1979 and 1980. He returned as a teacher in 1980, 1982, and 1984. According to Mitchell, his "primary concern is to explore the expressive qualities of wood in order to create objects that transcend traditional forms of utility." He does this through the insightful understanding and careful control of wood and the changes in shape and texture it undergoes from a green, uncured state to a finished dried piece.

Most of her fairly short career was spent working under Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration, following the Stryker formula for "documenting" working-class life across the country during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Her New England pictures are eloquent examples of that formula, merging old and new New Englands into an (almost) comfortable relationship with each other. Her own inclination, after studies at the New School for Social Research in New York and the University of Vienna (she heard Hitler speak in Berlin), was to be more of a social activist, an inclination that occasionally surfaces in her "off duty" pictures. In 1941, with husband Lee Wolcott, she moved to a farm in Virginia. For the next three decades she raised a family, taught school, and traveled with her husband, who joined the Foreign Service after a farming accident.

"27388","Artist Biography","<p>David Singer grew up in Pennsylvania Dutch country, where he was exposed to antiques and folk art. Another influence on his work, perhaps related to the hex signs of folk art, was his childhood interest in geometric forms. Although Singer had little formal art training, his polished presentation and prodigious output made him one of the most respected poster artists emerging in the late 1960s in San Francisco.</p><p>Not initially interested in making posters, Singer assembled a portfolio of collages that he envisioned as "greeting cards or something." His work was rejected by most of the publishers in San Francisco before gaining immediate acceptance from Bill Graham, a dance-concert promoter for the Fillmore Auditorium. During the Fillmore era, from 1969 to 1971, Singer created more posters for Graham than any other artist did, notably the double-size final poster evoking the Fillmore experience. Even after the Fillmore closed in 1971, Singer continued to create posters commemorating special events sponsored by Graham. To a great extent, Singer was a transitional rock-poster artist; his works possessed a refinement, even a polish that would dominate the 1970s rock world. During that decade he produced significant posters for the Rolling Stones, the Who, and Santana.</p><p>Singer's posters are notable for his use of collage, incorporating thousands of images clipped from magazines spanning several decades. He developed a format that included a stunning variety of lettering styles, applying them in close relation to the theme or subject of a poster.</p><p>Therese Thau Heyman <i>Posters American Style</i> (New York and Washington, D.C.: Harry N.

"27389","Artist Biography","<p>Wes Wilson attended San Francisco State University and was working at Contact Printing, a small San Francisco press, when his career as a psychedelic poster artist took off. At Contact, Wilson did the layout and design for handbills that eventually established him as a poster designer. When the Avalon Ballroon and Bill Graham's Fillmore Auditorium began to hold weekly dance concerts, Wilson was called upon to design the posters. He created psychedelic posters from February 1966 until May 1967, when disputes over money severed his connection with Graham. Wilson's early work was unique, but by mid-1967, so many artists had copied his style that he was easily replaced.</p><p>Wilson claims that he was the first artist to create a psychedelic poster. Intended for a particular audience&mdash;one that was tuned in to the psychedelic experience&mdash;his art, especially the lugubrious, freehand lettering, emerged from Wilson's own involvement with that experience and the psychedelic art of light shows. His influential lettering was derived from the Viennese Secessionist lettering he discovered in a University of California exhibition catalogue.</p><p>Wilson's approach to poster making was quite improvisatory. According to the artist, he selected colors through visual experiences with LSD, as well as from his professional experience as a printer. Eventually disillusioned with the career and financial opportunities of poster art, he moved to the Missouri Ozarks, where he lives on a farm.</p><p>Therese Thau Heyman <i>Posters American Style</i> (New York and Washington, D.C.: Harry N.

In her early work, Larner examined issues of transformation and decay in a series of petri dish cultures that she also photographed. Her subsequent installations and sculptures address the way an object defines the space it occupies and transforms the viewer's perception of that space. The silhouette created by two intersecting arcs of nylon cord in her <I>Bird in Space</I> recalls the shape of Constantin Brancusi's classically modern 1928 sculpture of the same title. Larner's work has been widely shown in the United States and Europe, particularly in Austria, Germany, and France. In 1999 she won a Guggenheim Fellowship. The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles organized a retrospective of her work in 2001.</P>

"28683","Artist Biography","<p class="noindent">Glass artist Beth Lipman is renowned for her sculptural compositions which recreate the bounty and visual sumptuousness of Renaissance and Baroque still-life paintings, particularly 17th-century Dutch scenes. Lipman takes elements from these paintings&mdash;static composition, expressive light and opulent decoration&mdash;and translates the scenes into 3-D glass. Her objects, like those in the paintings, are chosen for their connotations. Overturned goblets and broken glass symbolize human frailty and mortality.</p>
<p>"Glass creates a tangible third dimension, capturing the painting’s polished quality," Lipman explains. "Its transparency suggests an ideal form, the essence of an object."</p>
<p>Lipman earned a bachelor of fine arts from the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in 1994. She has received grants from the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, Peter S. Reed Foundation, the New Hampshire State Council on the Arts/National Endowment for the Arts and the Ruth Chenven Foundation. Recently, she received the 2006 UrbanGlass Award for New Talent.</p>
<p>Lipman's work has greatly benefited from several artist-in-residence programs, including programs at The Studio at the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y.; the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wis.; and the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Wash. These residencies afforded her a team of glass artists to assist with large-scale works. Lipman's tour-de-force "Bancketje (Banquet)" (2003) was created during a residency at the Wheaton Arts and Cultural Center in Millville, N.J. and later exhibited at such venues as the Fuller Craft Museum in Brockton, Mass.; the Heller Gallery in New York City; and SOFA Chicago.</p>
<p>Lipman served as the education director at UrbanGlass in Brooklyn, N.Y. from 1997 to 2000. She has taught at the Pratt Fine Arts Center at New York University, the Parsons School of Design and the Bard Graduate Center, all in New York City. Since 2005 she has served as the Arts/Industry coordinator of the artist-in-residence program at the John Michael Kohler Arts Center.</p>",""

"777","Artist Biography","<P>A Kansan, born in Emporia in 1932, Wendell Castle attended the University of Kansas to earn a BFA in Industrial Design. "I could see after a brief industrial design job that no one was really interested in making things of sort of experimental or unusual nature … the only way I could make what I wanted to make was to make it myself."</P>
<P>"At that point I went into sculpture … and some of these pieces … quite by accident ended up by looking a bit like strange pieces of furniture with seats at the wrong heights and things like this.… That idea interested me and I began to go in that direction." Castle graduated from the from the University of Kansas with a MFA in Sculpture in 1961, moved to Rochester, New York, and began teaching at the School of American Craftsmen, Rochester Institute of Technology.</P>
<P>He proceeded to build up "a working vocabulary with wood" until he could make what he wanted in the way of sculptural forms that are useful as furniture. Castle's furniture concepts evolve chiefly from concern with support and are realized through three different approaches. The first is to treat the support, or base, sculpturally and as one with the sides and top, letting its form grow up and down and around like a living thing. The second is to allow a small base, anchor it to the floor, and— like a plant that will "come up with one very small stalk and still have lots of flowers,"—have it support several functional units of chair, table, lamp, desk, etc. The third approach is to eliminate a base entirely and fasten to the wall or ceiling a sculptural support that flows into useful surfaces of table or chair. The first approach is usually applied to separate, free-standing pieces of furniture; the second and third only can be used in more or less permanent installations.</P>
<P>Because laminating so greatly increases the natural strength of wood, Castle can make extraordinary demands on the wood he uses. His designs begin in the sketch book and most furniture pieces begin with an inch-thick layer of perfectly smoothed wood, growing upward course by course until a rough form is built, very close to finished size. He carves the convex areas with a chain saw dragged over the surface, and finishes with power chisels, routers, and other tools to make the subtle changes "you make because you want the piece really perfect." The final, week-long sanding job he turns over to his one helper. Castle works on several pieces at a time, moving from one to another as he sees clearly what to do next on each.</P>
<P>From the beginning Wendell Castle's work has been impossible to categorize, combining as it does a blend of sculpture and furniture that cannot be comfortably defined as one or the other. His layered creations built of countless individual pieces of wood become strikingly tree-like in their deliberate roundness and strong, slow curves. Castle defines his work as sculpture, with an added ingredient—"it performs some useful function in addition to, I hope, being beautiful."</P>
<P>As the youngest of this group of five contemporary craftsmen, Wendell Castle reflects changes in our educational system that today make it simpler to find a vocation as a craftsman. He is a person completely at home in what he does. Now living in Scottsville, he is Chairman of the Sculpture Department at the State University of New York in Brockport. In addition to teaching, Castle works continually on commissioned pieces and experiments with new ideas, recently introducing plastic furniture forms to be made and sold in signed editions.</P>
<P>None of the rooms Castle has done so far is as complete as the environments he hopes to make—"some really sizeable sort of control situation things where I could build more pieces that go together and have complete control over a room, doing it just the way I want it, including door handles and door frames and windows and windowsills and baseboards … where I pick out the glass in the window and really do the whole thing right."</P>

"2052","Artist Biography","<P class="no indent">Little is known about James Hampton, despite the grandeur of his self-chosen title, "Director, Special Projects for the State of Eternity." He was born in 1909 in Elloree, South Carolina, a small community of predominantly African-American sharecroppers and tenant farmers. His father, a gospel singer and self-ordained Baptist minister, left his wife and four children to pursue his itinerant calling.</P>
<P>In 1928, when he was nineteen, Hampton moved to Washington, D.C., to live with an older brother. Drafted into the Army in 1942, he served with a segregated unit that maintained airstrips in Saipan and Guam during World War II. Hampton returned to Washington in 1945, and began working a year later as a janitor for the General Services Administration until his death in 1964. Although he expressed interest in finding "a holy woman," to assist with his life’s work he never married and had few close friends.</P>
<P>Hampton was raised as a fundamentalist Baptist, but he disliked the concept of a denominational God and attended a variety of the city’s churches. As early as 1931, Hampton believed that he began receiving visions from God, and by 1945 it appears he had made one small, shrine-like object while stationed on Guam. This piece became part of his larger work, and is now placed in front of the center pulpit.</P>
<P>His work on <I>The Throne of the Third Heaven of the Nations Millennium General Assembly</I> probably began in earnest around 1950, when he rented a garage in his northwest Washington neighborhood, which was also the city's center of African-American business, religious, and night life. </P>
<P>Although a humble man, Hampton often referred to himself as "St. James." He may have considered himself a prophet like John, the author of The Book of Revelation, the biblical writing that inspired Hampton's belief in the Second Coming of Christ and his desire to build <I>The Throne</I> as a monument to the return of Christ to earth.</P>
<P>Hampton worked almost every day on his project, often starting his work at midnight after completing his janitorial duties. He continued his efforts until he died in 1964. The Throne was discovered and brought to the public's attention after his death. It is most likely Hampton's monument to his faith was never completely finished.</P>

"7496","Artist Biography","<P>Arthur Espenet Carpenter was born in New York City in 1920. He earned a B.A. in Economics and English from Dartmouth in 1942, then entered the Navy for four years, "giving me plenty of time to think of whether I wanted to end up in Wall Street or in my father's business, or whatever." After World War II he worked in the Oriental art importing business and decided he wanted to be "a part of the making, the production business. I wanted a physical job, some kind that would allow me to express myself creatively." So, just to see if he could do it, he moved to San Francisco, bought a lathe and with no idea of becoming a craftsman—rather to make things, sell them, and be independent—he began making wooden bowls and other treen ware.</P>
<P>In a few years his bowls were being sold at select stores across the county and when his work was chosen for the Museum of Modern Art's Good Design Exhibits in 1950, Carpenter discovered the world of crafts and craftsmen. Continuing to produce wooden bowls he slowly taught himself the necessary skills and acquired machinery for making furniture—wooden forms with greater creative possibilities.</P>
<P>By the mid-50s Carpenter found himself with a thriving custom furniture buisness with six employees and no time to build any pieces himself. "I was becoming just what I was running away from … the business man, waiting on customers, doing the selling, and telling the employees what to do."</P>
<P>To restore what he considered a lost balance, he moved his family to Bolinas, California where, after a lean first year, customers began coming to his rural location. Not knowing in the beginning that it would take eight years to finish, Carpenter decided to build a house. With an architect's plan for a basic guide "so I'd know what beams would hold up what," and with wood from an old barn on the hilltop property he slowly built a unique circular house near his shop.</P>
<P>Under the name "Espenet" he accepts church and library commissions but feels his shop is better scaled to special orders from individuals. Eleven months of the year he works with his three workmen producing furniture, saving the twelfth month for a rest period, a time to work out new designs. A half-dozen of these new designs may be put in his showroom for customers to see.</P>
<P>Much of his work is one-of-a-kind pieces. Some customers simply designate what they need and give him freedom to proceed as he likes, others ask for a sketch or model first. Many come to his showroom for the first time, to order perhaps a dining room table, return in a year for eight chairs to go with it, and later for other pieces, "so, in time I find that once I sell something to a customer, I'm selling to the same customer for the next five, six years."</P>
<P>A primitive directiness and strength characterizes Carpenter's furniture, and seeing no point in "making ivory balls within ivory balls," he tries to find the most economic use of time and material.</P>
<P>"My whole thing has been utility. If it isn't comfortable and if it doesn't last and if it doesn't function, it's no good. Furniture to me is something the body touches." He makes a direct appeal to the senses by providing smooth, rounded surfaces for the hand, comfort for the body, contrasting and richly grained woods for the eye, and by using unfinished Japanese oak in cabinets because of that wood's pleasant odor, something for the nose.</P>
<P>With no thought of giving up his established furniture business, Arthur Carpenter is looking toward teaching as a way to develop another facet of his woodworking, noting with amusement that teaching is "usually the way, as a matter of fact, that most craftsmen subsidize themselves … so I'm sort of doing it backwards." Because of his own early struggle to find a vocation he has strong opinions about education. Carpenter belives his life as a craftsman enables him to use every facet of skill and knowledge he possesses. To him, "There's no reason why you shouldn't have a good education and still be a carpenter or a bricklayer if you want … and be satisfied in that area. … The better education you have, I think, the better you can do it."</P>

"1457","Artist Biography","<P>"I started as a painter and had exhibitions in Alabama, Washington D.C., and Chicago. Then I found I wasn't painting like Wharton Esherick ought to paint, so I started with sculpture, then with furniture," Wharton Esherick describes finding his best medium of expression—building interiors and furniture of wood. The change from two-dimensional painting and printmaking to sculpture in three dimensions for him led naturally to building furniture; and people bought his furniture.</P>
<P>Esherick was born in Philadelphia in 1887 and studied at that city's School of Industrial Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Esherick's work in wood, beginning in the mid-1920s, reflected the time he lived through. His style evolved through carved surfaces and complex line with angular planes until he developed the sensitive shaping of curved form imbued with energetic life that became his own way with wood. For as he said, "Some of my sculpture went into the making of furniture."</P>
<P>He took particular joy in the interaction of idea and material, the play of blending a furniture form he had in mind with the natural variations he found in the wood. A crack might be sanded to emphasize its shape, a knot might be left higher than the surrounding surface to become a point of tactile interest, the very conception of his design could be directed by the flow of grain in a piece of wood.</P>
<P>At first he worked by himself, but as demand for his special kind of design grew, so did his workshop, which in time became fully mechanized, for Esherick welcomed the help of useful tools. Perhaps because he was first of all an artist, and because he considered the hand as another tool, he believed that handcraft was secondary to design, though craftsman he was. He put into his work "a little of the hand, but the main thing is the heart and the head." In his own mind, Wharton Esherick was simply a man who made furniture "under personal supervision and with personal concern." He worked with a varying number of helpers and left to them much of the joinery and finishing, keeping for himself only the special wood problems requiring his own hand and judgment. In 1969, a year before his death, he was "still shaping the seats of the stools. The boys just don't get the hang of it."</P>
<P>During his enormously productive life as a woodworker, Esherick completed many interiors. Some, like his rooms for the Curtis Bok house in Gulph Mills near Philadelphia, are counted among the most important interiors of the 1930s; but his masterwork is the house he built for himself near Paoli, Pensylvania. There on a wooded hillside he laid the stone foundations for his home and studio in 1926 and spent the rest of his life working on it, seldom even wanting to go away for a visit. He liked best to use the wood native to his own land, believing that "if I can't make something beautiful out of what I find in my back yard, I had better not make anything."</P>
<P>Long hours went into improving and finishing his house until in time the house seemed to <I>become</I> Esherick. Of it he said, "I am only Esherick the man, but all of this is really Esherick." The house exemplifies his sculptural concepts; it is filled with patient and thoughtful and often humorous detailing of walls, doors, ceiling, floors, and bult-in seating and beds. He furnished it with his own sculpture and furniture prototypes, for he kept "number one" of any design himself.</P>
<P>Esherick did not accept apprentices, declaring, "I make, I don't teach," but his work is a recognized influence on the course of wood craftsmanship in America. Sam Maloof and Wendell Castle each acknowledge Esherick as the man whose work proved to them woodworing could be important and expressive.</P>
<P>Because he was self-taught as a sculptor and furniture craftsman, he directed any person interested in following his path just to begin, and to learn by making mistakes—"Then you have to work twice as hard to correct the mistakes and the thing begins to take shape." He summed up: "Listen, if you go into this thing that I'm doing, you'll have a hell of a struggle—but you'll have fun."</P>

"6795","Artist Biography","<P class=noindent>Cliff Lee was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1951, where his father was stationed as ambassador. Lee began his education in Taiwan and moved to the United States in 1968 to attend Eastern Mennonite College, where he earned a degree in biology in 1971. He attended medical school in the 1970s at the Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State College, specializing in neurosurgery. After starting work as a physician, and looking to reduce stress after long workdays, Lee enrolled in a ceramics class at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. It was there that he found the two passions of his life: studio pottery and his future bride, Holly, a jewelry designer. Lee enrolled in the school's ceramics master's program and received his degree in 1976.</P>
<P>From the start, Lee and his wife have sold their own work. Their first gallery was in Arlington, Virginia, followed by the Georgetown section of Washington, DC. They currently live near Stevens, Pennsylvania, and sell work directly from their studio or at major craft shows such as the ACC Baltimore Show, the Philadelphia Museum of Art Craft Show, and the Smithsonian Craft Show. In 1993, President and Mrs. Clinton invited Lee to contribute to the White House Collection of American Crafts, an exhibition that toured the country. Lee's work is now included in the permanent collections of several museums, including the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Renwick Gallery; the Mint Museum of Craft + Design, Charlotte, NC; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT; and the Racine Art Museum, Wisconsin. He has received numerous awards at craft shows. His work has been exhibited around the world and featured in publications, including <I>Craft in America: Celebrating Two Centuries of Artists and Objects</I> (2007) and the subsequent television series.</P>

"3497","Artist Biography","<P>Inez Nathaniel went north to Philadelphia during the Great Migration of the 1930s to escape the harsh realities of farm work in the rural South. Convicted of the manslaughter of an abusive male acquaintance, she served time in the Bedford Hills, New York, Correctional Facility from 1971 to 1972, where she began to draw to isolate herself from the "bad girls" in the facility. When she remarried in1975, she took her new husband's name, Walker. Walker's drawings are almost exclusively single or paired portraits of females. In most of her works, the heads are drawn much larger and more expressively than the rest of the figures and dominate thecomposition. Though Walker never felt she was able to capture a likeness, and she relied on her imagination to develop the faces, she created clearly recognizable characters. Some recur frequently. Elements of self-portraiture are also evident in her figures, many of whom wear clothing, especially hats, based on the artist's own.</P>

"23","Luce Artist Biography","<p>Despite his working-class background, Herbert Adams insisted on becoming an artist. His father discouraged him on practical grounds and was successful in getting Adams to attend technical school, at least temporarily. At eighteen, the artist worked as a taxidermist, which only increased his desire to study art---especially sculpture. After two years of hard work his patience paid off. He was allowed to enroll at the Massachusetts Normal Art School in Boston. Adams excelled in sculpture and continued his studies, first at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then in Italy, where he was particularly influenced by the work of the Renaissance period. This influence is visible in many of his portrait busts, which are colored in warm tones instead of being rendered in solid white marble. Adams combined different types of marble with wood and gold to color his marble busts, and applied stains or paints to tint the surface of his plaster works.</p>",""

"27792","Luce Artist Quote","<p>When John Eric Byers's mother noticed his early interest in working with his hands, she provided him with antique woodworking tools. In college he studied industrial arts but after attending an open house at Wendell Castle School in Scottsville, NY (known for fine woodworking and furniture design), he decided to attend the school with the goal of becoming a studio artist. While he was there, Byers developed his own style of geometric, asymmetrical black-and-white cabinets and benches. Eventually his work evolved to be curvy and colorful while maintaining functionality. Byers experimented with different types of paint but finally settled on milk paint, which is made from clay filler and earth pigment, to create warm-toned mosaic patterns on the surface of his structures. He meticulously hand-carves, paints, sands, and repaints each square in the pattern up to six times to achieve the desired silky texture and opaque color. Since early 2000, Byers has moved away from functional furniture pieces and instead creates wall panels that display his signature mosaic-like surface pattern on red mahogany wood.</p>",""

Brown's influences varied greatly: Edward Hopper, folk art, surrealism, Japanese art, medieval art, and 1940s-era advertisements and cartoons, to name a few. By combining certain elements from each of these inspirations, Brown's paintings become legible and accessible to all viewers. (SAAM curatorial file)</p>",""

After serving in World War I, Browne moved to Alberta, Canada. His wife later recalled that this was the most productive period of his artistic career. He painted outdoors, even in winter, when he often needed to wear multiple pairs of socks on his hands "with the brushes pulled through so that he could move his fingers easily within the socks" (Ordeman and Schreiber, <i>George and Belmore Browne: Artists of the North American Wilderness</i>, 2004). Browne eventually began to spend his winters in California and was named director of the Santa Barbara School of Fine Arts in 1930.

Byron Browne worked at a lumberyard to pay his tuition at the National Academy of Design, where he enrolled in 1925. He was inspired by European artists such as Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró and in 1930 burned several of his realistic works as a gesture against conventional painting. He was a founder of the American Abstract Artists and in 1935 led a march protesting museums that did not collect modern work. After World War II, Browne exhibited frequently at the Kootz Gallery, which ardently supported avant-garde American artists. While abstract expressionism dominated New York’s art world, Browne’s paintings, which still showed recognizable figures and objects, failed to draw an audience. The gallery sold all of Browne’s work in a department store sale at “50% off,” dealing a heavy blow to the artist’s career. (Rogers, <i>Byron Browne, A Seminal American Modernist</i>, 2001)</p>",""

Claude Buck started to paint when he was very young and at the age of eight applied to be a copyist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

His work was criticized, however, because rather than celebrate working America like many artists of the 1930s, he emphasized the sordid behavior of the “common man.” One painting of carousing sailors offended the assistant secretary of the Navy, who demanded its removal from an exhibition.

William Gropper’s parents were Jewish immigrants who worked in the sweatshops of New York City’s garment district. Their dignity in the face of hardship influenced their oldest son, who wrote that “I’m from the old school, defending the underdog.” (Klaidman, “William Gropper, 79, Painter and Radical Cartoonist Dies,” <i>The Washington Post</i>, January 9, 1977). As a teenager Gropper attended an experimental socialist school and took art courses with Robert Henri and George Bellows. Their respect for working people inspired Gropper to express his radical politics in cartoons. After winning several prizes for his drawings he took a job with the <i>New York Tribune</i>, but his bosses discovered his contributions to left-wing magazines and fired him. In 1937, Gropper had his first show and the <i>New Yorker</i> magazine described him as “one of the most accomplished, as well as one of the most significant artists of our generation.” During the “Red scare” of the postwar years, conservatives grew suspicious of his images lambasting the rich and powerful. Gropper was asked to appear before the McCarthy Senate permanent investigations subcommittee, where he took the Fifth Amendment. He was branded a Communist and saw several of his gallery shows cancelled. This experience did nothing to stop the artist from making satirical images about war, prejudice, greed, and exploitation into his late seventies.

While pursuing his master of science in ceramics at Illinois State University, Hoadley was introduced to the ancient Japanese pottery technique called nerikomi, which he uses to create his exquisite bowls and platters. In nerikomi, layers of colored clays are stacked repeatedly, creating a "loaf" that is later cut and assembled, often using a mold. The technique is similar to the more commonly known Italian glass technique millefiori. Hoadley typically creates ten-pound loaves comprising thousands of layers.

Her most famous subjects included the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, Giuseppe Garibaldi, the revolutionary who led Italy to a unified state, and "mad" King Ludwig II of Bavaria. She gave up her career, however, to form a utopian socialist retreat, first in Georgia then in Liendo, Texas, where she and her friends could live "surrounded by the unspoiled beauties of nature, aided by the influence of art and science, [so that] each individual [may] develop, according to his own nature." At first, Ney's Texas neighbors were suspicious of her unconventional European dress, her feminism, and her socialist politics; the children even thought she was a witch. Nevertheless, the locals eventually recognized her talent, and she won many commissions in the state. Her Austin studio, Formosa, became a small salon where the area’s most cultivated people came to discuss art, politics, and "the larger aspects of life" with the artist, who never lost her German accent. Ney died in 1907 and is buried at her plantation in Liendo. Her Austin studio is now the home of the Elisabet Ney Museum.

During the Great Depression, he became involved in politics and Socialism, which led him to writing assignments for the Socialist magazine <i>Arise.</i> He wrote art criticism throughout his life, and in 1951 he was appointed associate editor for <i>Art News.</i> Although a representational painter during a period more noted for abstraction, Porter rejected claims that he was continuing the tradition of American realist painting. He felt that his ambitions had more in common with the abstract artists of his generation such as Willem de Kooning and Joan Mitchell, because he valued the process of painting more highly than any desire to accurately record the subject in front him. Porter's paintings often depict his immediate environment and were mostly created at the family house in Southampton, New York, or at his vacation home at Great Spruce Head Island, Maine.</p>",""

Growing up on a farm in Woodstock, Vermont, he had never seen a statue, but frequently dreamed of a female figure standing on a pillar---a vision that was to haunt him throughout his life. In 1818 his family moved to Cincinnati. His father died soon after their arrival, however, and Powers left home to seek his fortune. His first experience in portraiture came through working in a hotel, where he created silhouette cutouts of visitors. A few years later, he created a stir at the local museum by mechanically animating wax figures so that they appeared to be alive. He enrolled at Cincinnati’s Academy of Fine Arts in 1828 and attracted the attention of a local patron, Nicholas Longworth, who encouraged Powers to travel to Washington in pursuit of his career. In Washington, the artist modeled a portrait of President Andrew Jackson, a piece that led to many more commissions and brought Powers his first recognition as a portrait artist. In order to establish his professional credentials, Powers moved to Florence with his family in 1837. There he was able to train as a sculptor while taking advantage of the skilled workmen and abundant materials. He invented tools that made the process of stonecutting more efficient, including a pointing machine that transferred the shape of the model to the marble replica <b>[see special installation]</b>. Powers remained in Italy for the rest of his life, creating numerous portrait busts and many idealized figures from religion and history.</p>",""

"3918","Luce Artist Biography","<p>Elsa Rady's love of ceramics dates to her childhood. Her parents enrolled her in classes, at age seven, at New York's Greenwich House Pottery; friend and classmate Carol Sackler, daughter of art collector Arthur M.

In the 1960s, Rady studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles (now the California Institute of the Arts). Especially important to the development of her mature work was the school's emphasis on tradition and innovation, providing students with a solid foundation in classic ceramic forms while encouraging fresh interpretations. It was at Chouinard that Rady deepened her understanding of Chinese ceramics, and her elegant unadorned pieces from this time show the influence of Song dynasty wares.

Daniel Jocz began his career as a sculptor, but began making jewelry in the 1980s.

Jocz often works in series, and his style has changed considerably since the early days of his artistic career, shifting from geometric abstractions, to lifelike forms, to playful pop art-inspired “candy wear.” Jocz admires jazz music’s improvisational rhythms, and believes a similar “chaotic order” can be found in his own jewelry.</p>",""

He was first drawn to ceramics because of the strong connection he felt a pot could make between the artist and viewer no matter how old a piece was. Because of this, he has aimed to produce pots that speak to his individuality as an artist and human being and hopes to connect with his viewers on a personal level.</p>",""

Mary Shaffer began her career as a painter, an ambition she’d had since the age of nine. A busy job and two young children prevented her from painting very often, however, and she spent several years thinking about what she wanted to do and jotting down her ideas. Her work in glass began in the early 1970s when she developed the technique of midair slumping. This involves placing sheets of plate glass on a structural form in a kiln, until the heat causes the glass to bend and sag. Shaffer’s powerful sculptures combine twisted wire or rigid blocks of metal with flowing layers of clear glass.</p>",""

Marilyn Druin taught herself the art of enameled jewelry in the 1960s while studying art education.

The hot glass eventually cools and hardens into either a transparent, translucent, or opaque material. When Druin started enameling, she used the cloisonné technique, a process of manipulating silver or gold wire to form compartments that hold the liquid glass in place as it cools. Druin eventually incorporated a technique called <i>basse-taille</i>, French for “low-cut,” in which the surface of the metal is engraved before the glass is applied over it.

She traveled to Boston and established herself as a professional artist, studying with a local sculptor and creating portraits of famous antislavery heroes. Moving to Rome in 1865, she became involved with a group of American women sculptors and began to work in marble. Sculptors usually hired local workmen to carve their final pieces, but Lewis did all her own stonework out of fear that if she didn't, her work would not be accepted as original. In addition to creating portrait heads, Lewis sculpted biblical scenes and figural works dealing with her Native American heritage and the oppression of black people.",""

"26","Artist Biography","<P>The works of basket maker Mary Adams represent the ingenious marriage of traditional Mohawk crafts with contemporary popular forms. Adams, who is in her sixties, teaches basketry at the local reservation museum twice a week. Half a dozen traditional basket makers work near Adams on the St. Regis Reservation, including her sister, Margaret.</P>
<P>After coming into contact with Europeans in the late eighteenth century, the Algonkian and Iroquoian peoples replaced their indigenous style of basketry —stitched wood and bark, twining, and plaited matting—with the plaited and woodsplint technique common to Germanic and Swedish colonists. The sharp points of woodsplint in the Wedding Cake Basket [SAAM 1989.30.1] are a variation of the porcupine twist or "curlicue" manipulation of the splints, recognized as "thistle weave" in the distinctive Mohawk style. Adams skillfully contrasts protruding design elements with the smooth texture of surface splints, which are interwoven with sweet grass.</P>

"26","Artist Biography","<P>Mary Adams's life—her dual Mohawk and Catholic heritage—is interwoven with her splint ash and sweet grass baskets. During a childhood of poverty in the late 1920s along the banks of the St. Lawrence Riber on the Mohawk Akwesasne Reserve, which straddles the New York/Canadian border, she made baskets to provide for herself and her brother. Later, freed from the economic necessity of having to produce them for a living, she devoted her time to creating innovative, ornate baskets and grew into an artist of international stature. Highly sculpted basketry art forms such as the Wedding Cake Basket, which she made in 1986 for the twenty fifth wedding anniversary of one of her children, and the Pope Basket represent the ulmination of her life's work. (1)<P>I was honored to interview Adams a few months before her death on May 23, 1999, at age eighty two, at her daughter Trudy Lauzon's home in Fort Covington, New York, near the reserve. We talked about her work, especially the creation and presentation of a basket to John Paul II in 1980 to commemorate the beatification of Kateri Tekakwitha, the first Native American to be declared "blessed" by the Roman Catholic Church.</P>
<P>Mary Kawennatakie Adams, whose traditional name means a "voice coming toward us," was born January 24, 1917, at Kawehnoke, or Cornwall Island, Ontario. She was a member of the Wolf Clan of the Kahnawake Mohawk Nation ("People of Flint") of the Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee). She had no formal education after age sixteen and did not learn English until well into adulthood.<P>From her mother, Adams learned to make traditional Mohawk splint ash and sweet grass baskets when she was six years old. When she was ten, her mother died, and her father left the reserve to seek employment as an ironworker, a common practice among the Mohawk, who were legendary in producing generations of skillful high steel workers for tall buildings and bridges. Left behind on the reserve to support herself and her older brother, Adams began making baskets.</P>
<P>To begin the process, she followed her mother's example, and instructed her brother to fell the ash trees so that she could prepare the wood splints. Within a few days, Adams had made about a dozen baskets and sent her brother to the local non Native American merchant, Mr. MacKinnon, who traded them for cigarettes. When her brother asked her what she would do with cigarettes, she told him that they would take them to Cornwall, acrosss the north channel of the St. Lawrence, to another merchant to trade them for cash. She and her mother had often visited him, before the family moved south to the Quebec part of the St. Regis community on the Akwesasne Reserve.</P><P>Adams told me of her relief when, after presenting the cigarettes to him, he automatically gave her the money, without asking her anything. She did not know English and would have been unable to understand him. She used the cash for food and other necessities. She explained further, "Sometimes, we would [be] sitting all night working on the baskets to get done, so we would get the money to buy our groceries. That is the way we were, I don't kow how many years."</P>
<P>Adams married at age seventeen and continued to sell her baskets to Mr. MacKinnon, for cash now instead of cigarettes. Adams recounted that he "ripped her off" for the little three&nbsp; or four inch sweet grass and splint ash baskets: "That son of a gun, he pays [for the] basket twenty five cents a dozen. The whole reservation, we used to make baskets. Son of a gun, he never pay any more than that, twenty five cents, that kind of basket." With a strong Mohawk accent, Adams continued, "When my mother used to make baskets, she sits on the rocking chair and you all sit around her and she teaches us how to make baskets. Then after she is gone, then I keep on. I never quit, not even a day. Every day I am doing them, and I have got a big family. I raised my family with my bakets. I have got twelve kids."</P>
<P>Adams's tenacity in making baskets full time produced an income that provided stability for her large family in the St. Regis community. (2) She ws also active in her church, the St. Regis Roman Catholic Church, which was founded as a Jesuit Mission in 1752. Continuing the community centered tradition of the Mohawk, Adams shared the original patterns and surface designs in her basketry with her family and the women at Akwesasne, and also traveled widely to give demonstrations of Mohawk basket making.</P>
<P>By the time she reached her early fifties, Adams was finally financially independent. No longer burdened with meeting the demands of wholesale basket merchants, Adams had time to execute baskets that were imaginative and distinctive. Later, she began making the ornate baskets for which she received international acclaim. Her baskets are found in institutions throughout North America, including the Iroquois Indian Museum, New York; the Thunder Bay Art Gallery, Ontario; the New York State Governor's Collection of Art, Albany; and the Smithsonian, Washington, D.C. In 1997 the Iroquoiss Indian Museum presented her with its "Excellence in Iroquois Arts Award" for the category "The Best of the Best." (3)</P>
<P>Like other parishioners at St. Regis Catholic Church, Adams ws a devotee of Kateri Takawitha, a seventeenth century Kahnawake Mohawk woman, known as "The Lily of the Mohawks." Takakwitha was the daughter of a Christian Algonquin mother and a non Christian Mohawk chief. Her parents and brother died in a smallpox epidemc; she survived, but the disease weakened her health and severly scarred her face. She performed extraordinary penances and was devoted to helping children and the elederly. It is said that because of her great faith her pockmarks disappeared when she died at the age of twenty four. In 1943, the Roman Catholic Church delcared her "venable." Later, the Church declared her blssed, the second of three steps toward canonization.<P>Wishing to attend the beatification ceremony at the Vatican, Adams and her fellow parishioners raised funds to cover their expenses. Adams wanted to make a commemorative basket in Kateri's honor to present to Pope John Paul II. She saw this act of gift giving as honoring both her Christian and Mohawk roots. The gift symbolized the Christian tradition of presenting a Eucharist offering to the pope who would say mass for the occasion. It also represented the Iroquois ceremony of giving thanks to natural and supernatural beings for their generosity, a kind of gift exchange or thanksgiving. (4) ?</P<P>Significantly, Adams drew from her Mohawk heritage and the traditional cosmology of the Northeastern Native American Indian by placing clusters of tiny baskets on four equidistant walls and the lid of the [Pope B]asket. The sweet grass used in the basket's contruction is sacred to many Native Americans, and to the Mohawk people in particular. There is a saying in Akwesasne that the basket making community lives where Teionkwahontasen, or sweet grass, "grows around us or surrounds us." (6) Indeed, I saw sweet grass near Adams's home on a channel of the St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>Adams's lifelong ambition, like that of other Mohawk basket makers, was to continue making baskets until she died. During her life, she produced more than twenty five thousand baskets and developed traditional Mohawk basketry into a highly decorative art form. Almost up until the time of her death in 1999, and even with failing eyesight, she was still able to braid sweet grass, which she then gave to her daughter to incorporate into her baskets. Just as Adams learned the technique of making baskets form her mother, Trudy learned the craft from her. Adams's baskets are woven from her life story, reflecting her experiences as both a Catholic, intimate with liturgical symbolism, and a Kahnawake Mohawk, surrounded by sweet grass growing abundantly in the flowing river marshes of Akwesasne.</P>

My intention is to reveal through pictorial complexities the life I know." — "Romare Bearden, The Human Condition" (New York: ACA Galleries, 1991), 2.</P>
<P>Romare Bearden, the only child of Richard Howard and Bessye Johnson Bearden, was born in 1912 in Charlotte, North Carolina, in the heart of Mecklenburg County. Shortly after his birth, Bearden's parents moved to New York City where his father worked as a sanitation inspector, and his mother became the New York editor of The Chicago Defender newspaper and the first president of the Negro Women's Democratic Association.</P>
<P>During the early 1920s the period of cultural flowering in the African American community known as the Harlem Renaissance was in its formative stages. The Bearden apartment on West 131st Street in Harlem was a frequent gathering place for such intellectuals as W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, and Countee Cullen, as well as artists Aaron Douglas and Charles Alston, and jazz musicians Fats Waller, Duke Ellington, and Andy Razaf. The Lincoln Theatre, Savoy Ballroom, and a number of other night spots were only a few blocks from the Bearden apartment, and Bearden became deeply immersed in jazz and the Blues as an adolescent.</P>
<P>In 1925, Bearden went to Pittsburgh where he lived with his maternal grandmother and graduated from Peabody High School in 1929. His grandmother operated a boarding house that catered largely to steel mill workers, many of whom had recently emigrated from the South. New York City, Charlotte, and Pittsburgh were the cities of Bearden's childhood, and each made an indelible impression on Bearden as an artist many decades later. His artistic interests were developed in Pittsburgh when his boyhood friend, Eugene Bailey, taught him how to draw. Following Bailey's death in 1925, Bearden's interest in art waned.</P>
<P>Bearden had not considered a profession as an artist when he enrolled in New York University in the early 1930s. He graduated in 1935 with a B.S. degree in mathematics. During his years at New York University, however, Bearden worked as a cartoonist for the university's humor magazine, Medley, did editorial drawings for the Baltimore Afro American, and worked for Colliers and the Saturday Evening Post.<BR>In 1935 Bearden decided to become a professional artist after a meeting of a group of African American artists who later became the Harlem Artists Guild. In 1936 Bearden joined an informal group of black artists in Harlem, the 306 Group—named after the studio lofts at 306 West 141st Street where the group met. During the same year, Bearden enrolled at the Art Students League where he studied under German expressionist George Grosz. A strong influence, Grosz introduced Bearden to the works of Daumier, Goya, Breughel, and Köllwitz, as well as Ingres, Dürer, Holbein, and Poussin.</P>
<P>Bearden left the Art Students League after a year and a half, painted part time, and found employment as a caseworker in the New York City Department of Social Services. By 1940 Bearden had begun to paint in tempera on brown paper. From 1942 to 1945, Bearden served in the army. After his discharge, he held his first one man exhibition in a New York gallery—works from the "Passion of Christ" series—at the Samuel M. Kootz Gallery in 1945.</P>
<P>In 1950,Bearden decided to go to Paris and study philosophy part time at the Sorbonne on the G.I. Bill. In Paris, Bearden met painter Georges Braque, sculptor Constantin Brancusi, and a number of French and American artists and writers living in Paris. He visited museums and galleries while traveling to Nice, Florence, Rome, and Venice. Having produced no paintings in Paris, Bearden returned to New York in 1951. He abandoned painting for two years while concentrating on songwriting, and a number of his songs were published. In 1952 Bearden resumed his caseworker duties, and two years later he married Nanette Rohan, a dancer and artist. During the mid 1950s, with the encouragement of his friends and wife, Bearden resumed painting, concentrating on oils and acrylics.<BR>Very conscious of the evolution of his style, Bearden once stated that his early temperas of the 1930s were composed of closed forms with colors that were primarily earthy browns, blues, and greens. When he began painting watercolors he employed bright color patterns with bold black lines to delineate shapes. The next step included oils that were largely extensions of his watercolors. He enlarged his initial sketches as photostats, traced them on gessoed panel, and completed an oil painting with a thinned color as if it were a watercolor. Bearden's early interest in flat painting was largely inspired by Stuart Davis, whom he met in 1940. Davis was deeply influenced by jazz and helped Bearden visualize a relationship between painting and jazz.</P>
<P>At the height of abstract expressionism's popularity in New York, Bearden experimented with its techniques between the late 1950s and early 1960s. He produced a series of nonrepresentational paintings in which organic forms merge. Bearden, however, was never satisfied with abstract expressionism because he felt that it lacked a philosophy. Bearden subsequently began experimenting with a technique in which he painted broad areas of color on various thicknesses of rice paper and glued the papers on canvas, usually in several layers. He then tore sections of the paper away, upward and across the picture plane, until a motif emerged. Finally, he added more paper and painted additional elements to complete the painting.</P>
<P>The turbulent decade of the 1960s sparked the most important stage in Bearden's career. In 1963 a group of African American artists in New York met in his studio to discuss how they could contribute to the civil rights movement. From this meeting the "Spiral" group was formed, and its members began to reassess their responsibilities as artists to society. One of the Spiral members suggested that Bearden enlarge his photomontages photographically. He experimented with this technique, but was not satisfied with the results. Arne Ekstrom, a New York art dealer, saw the rolled up photostats in Bearden's studio and was so impressed that he encouraged Bearden to create a series of the works for an exhibition, entitled "Projections," at Ekstrom's gallery in October 1964. The following year, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., organized a second "Projections" show, Bearden's first one man museum exhibition. The success of this series was such that he was able to support himself as a professional artist, and in 1966 Bearden gave up his job as a social worker.</P>
<P>The "Projections" series consists of monochromatic photomontages and photostats that Bearden called "Photo Projections." In these works, silhouettes of faces and hands have been cut from black and white photographs and then combined in carefully orchestrated designs. Scenes from African American life in Charlotte, Harlem, and Pittsburgh mark Bearden's return to figurative painting. Stylistically, the scenes were inspired by African sculptures, Chinese calligraphy, and European painters as diverse as Bosch, Zurbarán, and Mondrian. Although Bearden never considered himself a propagandist, his dramatic "Projections" seemed artistically appropriate for the new black pride movement. These works brought Bearden unprecedented success and remain this prolific artist's most acclaimed efforts.</P>
<P>Between 1967 and 1969, Bearden produced some of his largest and most innovative works. Memories of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, abound, reaffirming Bearden's roots in the rural South. Often incorporating life size imagery, these paintings combine collage with acrylics, drawings and oils, mosaics of real textures, and black and white photographs. Bearden always insisted that his works were paintings, not collages, because he used the techniques and materials of collage to create the rhythms, surfaces, tones, and moods associated with painting.</P>
<P>During the 1970s and 1980s, Bearden refined his style and continued to emphasize subjects derived from African American genre and myth. In 1977, an exhibition entitled Romare Bearden, Odysseus at Cordier and Ekstrom Gallery in New York, included paintings inspired by classical themes. Taken from the Homeric legends, these paintings incorporated larger and fewer collage elements, flat shapes of objects and people, and emphasized a single color such as blue or green. During the 1970s, motifs inspired by jazz and the Blues reappeared in Bearden's work; in 1977 an exhibition of monoprints, Of the Blues, received critical acclaim. By the late 1970s, Bearden began to use more vibrant and intense colors in his paintings, perhaps as a direct result of numerous trips to St. Martin in the West Indies, which is his wife's family home. During the 1980s the impact of this environment can also be seen in Bearden's final works, a watercolor series of Caribbean landscapes, seascapes, and portraits.</P>
<P>Bearden was also a writer. His first book, <EM>The Painter's Mind</EM>, was co written with the artist Carl Holty in 1969. He coauthored <EM>Six Black Masters in American Art</EM> in 1972 with Harry Henderson, and was working on a second book with Henderson,<EM> A History of African American Artists</EM>, at the time of his death. Bearden also organized several important exhibitions including Contemporary Art of the American Negro in Harlem in 1966 at what is now the site of the Studio Museum in Harlem, and in 1967, with art historian Carroll Greene, he organized "The Evolution of Afro American Artists: 1800–1950" at City College in New York. Bearden received five honorary doctoral degrees, and was elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1966. A year before his death in 1988, Bearden received the prestigious President's National Medal of the Arts.</P>

"1811","Artist Biography","<P>"I am a better artist today in that I am obviously a better teacher. Whether I am teaching or making art, the process is fundamentally the same: I am creating." — Sam Gilliam quoted in Curtia James, "Working With His Seven League Boots On," <EM>American Visions</EM> 4:1 (Feb. 1989): 27.</P>
<P>For the past twenty five years, Sam Gilliam has been internationally recognized as the foremost contemporary African American Color Field painter. He is most widely known for the large color stained canvases he draped and suspended from walls and ceilings during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Since that time Gilliam's style has undergone a number of phases, and he continues to explore new avenues of artistic expression.</P>
<P>Born in Tupelo, Mississippi, in 1933, Gilliam was the seventh of eight children of Sam and Estery Gilliam. Shortly after his birth, the Gilliams moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where the artist spent his childhood. Gilliam's father worked on the railroad, and his mother was a homemaker for the large family. Gilliam began painting by the time he was in elementary school, and recalls important encouragement from his fifth grade art teacher and a special art program at Louisville's Madison Junior High School. In 1951 Gilliam graduated from Central High School in Louisville. He attended the University of Louisville and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in fine arts in 1955. During that same year he enrolled in graduate school at the University of Louisville, and also had his first solo exhibition at the same institution. Gilliam served in the United States Army from 1956 to 1958. He returned to Louisville following his discharge, and completed his master of arts degree in fine arts at the University of Louisville in 1961.</P>
<P>Gilliam initially taught art for a year in the Louisville publischools. In 1962 he married Dorothy Butler, a Louisville native and a well known journalist. That same year, Gilliam moved to Washington, D.C., where he has lived ever since.</P>
<P>The background for Gilliam's art was the 1950s, which witnessed the emergence of abstract expressionism and the New York School followed by Field Painting. Although these developments were later to play major roles in Gilliam's style, he had no direct exposure to these movements during his years at the University of Louisville. His teachers in Louisville were influenced more by the emotionally charged art of the German Expressionists of the first half of thiscentury. Gilliam's paintings and drawings from graduate school in the late 1950s until his first one man exhibition in Washington in 1963 were primarily figural abstractions employing bold, dark colors of a brooding nature reminiscent of the works of German Expressionist Emil Nolde. An important contemporary influence whom Gilliam acknowledges during that period was Nathan Oliveira, a California figurative expressionist who held an exhibition in Louisville. Two other early influences were the fluidly luminous watercolors of Paul Klee, and the works of the German Expressionist group Die Brücke (The Bridge).</P>
<P>Although not an organized or self conscious movement, one of the most important developments in abstract art to emerge following abstract expressionism occurred in Washington, D.C., and is most often designated the Washington Color School. Artists identified with this movement include Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland, Thomas Downing, Paul Reed, Anne Truitt,and Gene Davis. The general course of this style developed from the more painterly abstractions of the 1950s to totally nonrepresentational, expansive, simplified works of clear bright colors through the 1960s. Morris Louis had died and Kenneth Noland had moved to New York by the time Gilliam arrived in Washington in 1962. Their works were well known in Washington, however, and in 1963 Gilliam met Thomas Downing who introduced him to Washington's realm of color art. At that point Gilliam decided to relinquish his earlier, brooding style in favor of nonrepresentational art. His earliest Washington works were large, clean edged paintings with flatly applied areas of color within the stylistic idiom of Washington Color Field Painting. Following that phase, Gilliam created early abstractions of diagonal stripes on square fields. During this time Gilliam experimented by taping and pouring colors, folding and staining canvases, and literally folding a still wet canvas against itself to imprint vertical, angular, and axial forms.</P>
<P>Around 1965 Gilliam became the first painter to introduce the idea of the unsupported canvas. Partially inspired by women hanging laundry on clotheslines he observed from the window of his Washington studio, Gilliam abandoned the frame and stretcher, and began to drape and suspend large areas of paint stained canvas. This innovative and improvisational technique was phenomenally successful and of widespread influence. Gilliam received numerous public and private commissions for his draped canvases, earning him the title "father of the draped canvas." These paintings were sometimes suspended from ceilings, arranged on walls, or on floors. They represent a third dimension in painting, and impart a sculptural quality. Though installed by the artist, Gilliam's draped canvases could be rearranged at will, and he has frequently embellished these works with metal, rocks, and wooden beams. One of the largest and final works of Gilliam's "draped" series was Seahorses of 1975 for the Philadelphia Museum of Art. This six part work involved several hundred feet of paint stained canvas, and was commissioned for the exterior walls of two adjacent wings of the museum.<BR>While at the height of his popularity as the creator of draped canvases, in 1975, Gilliam suddenly discontinued producing them and began creating dynamic geometric collages influenced by musicians Miles Davis and John Coltrane. By 1977 Gilliam was producing "Black Paintings", similar in technique to the collage paintings, but in predominantly black hues. In 1979 Gilliam's Wild Goose Chase series was inaugurated and featured slanted edges and designs reminiscent of quilt patterns.</P>
<P>Gilliam's method of paint application changed dramatically during the 1980s. His former technique of staining and saturating wet canvases was replaced by a method in which multiple layers of thick acrylic paint and gels are scumbled, spattered, and built up on the canvas in a rich impasto. Gilliam's "quilted" paintings of the 1980s involved cutting geometric shapes from his thickly encrusted canvas surfaces, and rearranging them on nylon or canvas backgrounds in patterns reminiscent of African American patchwork quilts the artist remembered from his childhood.</P>
<P>Gilliam's most recent works are textured paintings that incorporate or arejuxtaposed with metal forms. A noted series of this type was the D series that appeared in a one man exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1983 and employed a metal D shaped form at the bottom of each painting. Gilliam continues to produce new series, employs enamel as well as acrylic paints, and uses canvas, nylon, and awning materials in conjunction with aluminum and other metals. Gilliam's ability to move beyond the aesthetic of Washington Color Field Painting has assured his prominence as an exciting and innovative contemporary painter.</P>
<P>An outstanding creator of public art, Gilliam frequently works on a monumental scale and has received numerous major public commissions around the country. He is also one of the few successful, self supporting African American artists who views the teaching of art as a mission. His love of teaching developed during the one year he spent in the Louisville public schools. He taught for nearly a decade in the Washington public schools, and then at the Maryland Institute, College of Art and the University of Maryland, and for several years at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. In addition, Gilliam still devotes time to conducting workshops, articipating in panels, and delivering lectures in this country and abroad. He is an eloquent and articulate spokesman for his work. Gilliam has received two National Endowment for the Arts awards, fellowships from the Washington Gallery of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Foundation, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from his alma mater, the University of Louisville, in 1980.</P>

"2264","Artist Biography","<P>In 1966, a month before his death, Hans Hofmann described his process of painting in these words: "When I paint, I paint under the dictate of feeling or sensing, and the outcome all the time is supposed to say something. And that is most often my sense of nature. . . it might suggest landscape and might only suggest certain moods, and so on but this must be expressed in pictorial means, according to the inner laws of these means. Only this is acceptable as art."(1)</P><P>Hofmann was both an intuitive painter and a man with a profound understanding of modernism. He insisted on the importance of an analytical understanding of the means of painting. His ideas on art developed initially during his years in Paris. From 1904 to 1914, he knew Matisse, Picasso, Braque, and Delaunay. He frequented the Café du Dôme, where artists congregated to discuss not only ideas about art, but new theories of the universe, from Einstein's theory of relativity to Bergson's notion that movement and constant change are basic characteristics of reality.(2)</P>
<P>Hofmann grew up in Munich. As a gymnasium student, he excelled in music, science, and mathematics. At sixteen, as an assistant to the director of public works in Bavaria, his engineering skills became apparent. He invented a radar device for ships, a sensitized light bulb, and a portable freezer unit for use by military forces.(3) With a thousand marks as a gift from his proud father, Hofmann enrolled in art school. Soon he had encountered Impressionism, and discovered the Secession Gallery in Munich. The support of a patron allowed him to go to Paris. He attended evening classes at the Colarossi Academy and at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière. Hofmann became close friends with Jules Pascin and Robert Delaunay, whose theories on color seeded Hofmann's own ideas about color and form. At this time, Hofmann was painting Cubist still lifes, landscapes, and figurative pieces, and his work was included in group exhibitions at the New Secession Gallery in 1908 and 1909.</P>
<P>Hofmann went home for a visit in 1914. When World War I prevented his return to Paris, he opened his school for modern art in a Munich suburb. During the war years, Hofmann became closely acquainted with Kandinsky's work.(4) Following the war, young Americans began to flock to Hofmann's school. Carl Holty, Worth Ryder, Glenn Wessels, Vaclav Vytlacil, and others studied in Munich or attended his summer classes in Bavaria, France, and Italy.(5) In the summer of 1930, at the invitation of Worth Ryder, Hofmann taught at the University of California, Berkeley. He spent the next winter in Germany, and the following spring returned to teach in Los Angeles (at the Chouinard School of Art) and at Berkeley, where he wrote the first version of Creation in Form and Color: A Textbook for Instruction in Art. In 1932, he moved to New York. He taught for a year at the Art Students League, where his students included Burgoyne Diller, Harry Holtzman, and George McNeil. The following year he opened his New York school, and in the summer of 1935 began annual summer sessions in Provincetown, Massachusetts. In 1958, at age seventy eight, Hofmann finally gave up teaching to concentrate full time on painting.</P>
<P>It would be virtually impossible to overestimate Hofmann's importance as a teacher. Over half the original members of the American Abstract Artists were Hofmann students. Many second generation Abstract Expressionists worked with him as well. He provided scholarships to those unable to payfull tuition, and frequently allowed students to work for him in exchange for instruction. Whether or not they attended his classes, many artists knew of Hofmann's ideas. An essay entitled "Plastic Creation" was published in the Art Students Leaguemagazine during the winter of 1932?33, and a series of six lectures given during the winter of 1938?39 was attended by Jackson Pollock, Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, Clement Greenberg, and HaroldRosenberg.(6)</P>
<P>In his teaching, as in his art, Hofmann advocated nature as a starting point. He had students draw from life and from carefully arranged still life set ups to learn the importance of formal and spatial relationships. Although he promoted no style (many of his students were for years vague about Hofmann's own art), manyunderstood not only modernism, but Renaissance and Baroque art for the first time through Hofmann's explanations.(7) He considered drawing a critical precursor to painting, yet his emphasis on color, rather than perspective, as a determiner of space within a picture plane, lay at the heart of his ideas about art. For Hofmann, the artist worked to express the tension between three dimensional form and the two dimensional surface of the canvas. Yet in his own painting, he himself denied theory and method, and relied only on empathy.(8) Hofmann defined empathy as "the imaginative projection of one's own consciousness into another being or thing. In visual experience, it is the intuitive faculty to sense qualities of formal and spatial relations or tensions, and to discover the plastic and psychological quality of form and color."(9)</P>
<P>Hofmann's career as a teacher for many years disrupted his own work as an artist. From 1927 until 1935, he concentrated primarily on drawings?landscapes and figure sketches that reflected his early familiarity with Cubism. He began painting seriously again in 1935, and during the following decade landscapes, portraits, still lifes, and interior scenes were translated into highly expressionistic, energetic canvases. During the summers, especially, when Hofmann held sessions in Provincetown, he returned to landscapes such as Afterglow (1938). Subsequently, Hofmann began to pour and splatter paint, and increasingly exploited the accidental in his search for spontaneous expression.</P>
<P>Despite his renown as a teacher, it wasn't until 1944, at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery, that Hofmann had his first solo exhibition in the United States. There he became part of the emerging New York School, and was friendly with Pollock, Robert Motherwell, William Baziotes, Clyfford Still, and Mark Rothko. From that time on, Hofmann exhibited widely. The Addison Gallery of American Art organized a large retrospective of his work in 1948. In 1957 another was mounted at the Whitney Museum of American Art.</P><P>Although Hans Hofmann never joined the American Abstract Artists, he encouraged its membership and sent a letter of support when the organization was formally established. Yet, through his students, who represented not only a significant number of the membership, but an important counterbalance to the geometric formalists, Hofmann's influence within the group was remarkable.</P>

"2264","Luce Artist Biography","<P>Considered a master and forefather of abstract expressionism, Hans Hofmann grew up in Germany and as a young man worked for the Bavarian state. He decided to study art, however, and spent ten years in Paris, befriending such European modernists as Pablo Picasso and Robert Delaunay. When World War I broke out, he was unable to enlist because of a weak lung and decided to teach instead, opening the Hans Hofmann School of Fine Arts in Munich. In the early 1930s he moved the school to New York and taught summer classes in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where his teaching would influence a generation of American artists. Hofmann continued to paint while he taught, creating vibrant, abstract images that explored “color, light and form in the rhythm of life.” One of his students, Frank Stella, believed that Hofmann was “the greatest art teacher of the century.” (Stella, “Art of the Century,” quoted in Yohe, ed., <EM>Hans Hofmann</EM>, 2002)</P>",""

"2495","Artist Biography","<P>Frank Jones began to draw in 1964 while serving a life sentence for murder in the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville. (Jones maintained his innocence, but was incarcerated for most of his adult life.) His drawing materials were salvaged stubs of red and blue accountant's pencils and sheets of typing paper from the trash cans in the prison office where he worked. Later, as his drawings received favorable attention inside and outside the prison, he was given better paper and new colored pencils. Jones experimented with other colors, but preferred red and blue, which he said represented fire and smoke.</P>
<P>Jones, an African American, was born with a portion of fetal membrane over his left eye. In the African American tradition, as well as the traditions of other cultures as ancient as those of Greece and Rome, such a veil allows people to see spirits and devils. Jones first saw his "haints" (haunts or ghosts) and "devils" when he was nine and continued to see them throughout his life. He created several hundred complex drawings of houses that reveal these "haints" in cell like rooms. His horned "haints" characteristically assume physical attributes of animals and inanimate objects. Jones signed many of his works with his prison number until someone taught him to write his name, which he usually misspelled.</P>

Huntington Art Gallery, The University of Texas at Austin, 1989), 46.</P>
<P>Born around 1900 in Red River County, Texas, near Clarksville, Frank Jones spent twenty eight of his sixty nine years imprisoned in Texas for crimes he may not have committed. Details concerning Jones's early life are scant. His father deserted the family when Jones was three or four years old, and his mother abandoned him on a street corner when he was around five or six.<BR>After Jones was abandoned by his mother, he was taken in by Willie Dean Baker, an elderly black woman who raised him with the assistance of a neighbor, Della Gray. Jones never attended school or learned to read and write. During young adulthood he worked at a variety of odd jobs around Clarksville and neighboring towns.</P>
<P>Jones vividly recalled that his mother told him that he had been born with a "veil" or "caul" (part of the fetal membrane) over his left eye. Jones's mother said that this veil would enable him to see spirits. The "spirit veil" belief is widespread in African American culture, and has its genesis in black West Africa. Children who are born with a veil over their eyes are believed to have the power to see and communicate with spirits, as well as the ability to foresee the future.</P>
<P>Jones saw his first spirit or "haint" when he was around nine years old. He continued to have supernatural visions for the rest of his life. He compared his "double sightedness" to looking into a peephole and viewing the spirit world. Jones alternately referred to the spirits he saw as "haints," "devils," and "devil haints," but insisted that they were all the same. Assuming human, animal, bird, and inanimate forms, these devils were male or female and of many nationalities. For Jones their existence was real and universal, but to those who were not born with the veil they were invisible.</P>
<P>Jones's supernatural powers were well known in his East Texas community, where his early life was spent uneventfully. His long history of imprisonment began in 1941 when he was accused of raping a young woman whom he had raised after finding her abandoned in 1935. The child's mother appeared six years later and demanded the child. According to Jones, when he refused to relinquish custody of the girl, the mother charged him with rape. Jones claimed he was innocent, but was convicted and served two years and two months in prison.</P>
<P>Around 1945 Jones married Audrey Culberson, who had two adult sons. In 1949 Jones's foster mother Della Gray was robbed and murdered. One of Jones's stepsons was convicted of the murder and implicated Jones as well. Although Jones vigorously denied any knowledge of the crime, he was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. He served nine years of the sentence and was paroled. Jones returned to Clarksville and made plans to remarry. In 1960, however, a woman whom he hired to clean his house accused him of raping her. Jones denied the charge, and insisted that he had been "set up" by the girl and a male neighbor who disliked him. Jones was returned to prison as a parole violator; the rest of his life was spent in prison.</P>
<P>Jones's "artistic" career began during his third confinement in prison and spanned only a period of five years, from about 1964 to his death in early 1969. He focused on creating drawings, in red and blue pencil on paper, that invariably reflect visions based on experiences within prison and communication with the "haints" and "devils" of his spirit world.</P>
<P>Jones's earliest drawings were done with materials he found around the prison recreation office where he was assigned to work. He used red and blue pencil stubs discarded by prison bookkeepers and inexpensive typing paper often retrieved from wastebaskets. Jones's works received their earliest recognition through a prison art show in 1964. Shortly afterwards, a Dallas art gallery began marketing his work, and supplied him with larger, higher quality paper and additional colored pencils. Jones became increasingly prolific, and four months after his debut in the prison art show he held his first one man show at the gallery. This exhibition was well received by the public, and drew considerable media coverage that resulted in a number of interviews with Jones by members of the press. As a consequence of his prison celebrity status, Jones's material existence improved considerably. Indeed, he enjoyed the media attention, as he had never had a single visitor or received a single piece of mail during the previous fifteen years. In addition, he was held in high esteem by his fellow inmates, and the income from the sale of his drawings allowed him to purchase a radio and wristwatch—the only two luxuries in his bleak prison life.</P>
<P>Although Jones was active artistically for only five years, his style underwent noticeable changes. His first drawings, completed in 1964, depict his characteristic "devil houses," shown in multilevel architectural cross sections that reveal a variety of figures representing the spirits Jones claimed he saw. The colors red and blue dominate his drawings and he continued to prefer them even after he was provided with an array of colors. For Jones, red and blue symbolized smoke and fire and Hell. The spiked shapes that Jones identified as horns create patterns and also suggest movement. His early drawings are frequently populated by figures identified as flying fish and elongated winged figures shown in profile.</P>
<P>As Jones became more confident and his gallery supplied him with better materials, his"mature" style emerged. These later drawings are characterized by architectural structures filled with grinning figures that hover above floors and are suspended from ceilings. Enclosing the frenzied figures serves to neutralize them, not unlike how actual prison walls serve to limit the behavior of inmates. Although Jones was tormented and taunted by the devils of his spirit world, he rendered them powerless by capturing them on paper and enclosing them in cell like rooms. His representation of confined spirit people was also analogous to his life in prison.<BR>The single motif that appears in the majority of Jones's drawings is a large clock. Clocks hold a special significance for prisoners. Terms such as "doing time" or "pulling time" are common prison jargon, coupled with the fact that prison routine is regimented and based on strict time schedules. Since prisoners lose their freedom, they are constantly preoccupied with the passing of time and the time of their eventual release. In Jones's earliest drawings empty circles appear at the top of his "spirit houses." Later these circles developed into clocks with hands, indicating specific times; in some instances the clocks have multiple hands and appendages that spin off or orbit around them. These changes were probably related to Jones's continual requests for parole and its subsequent denial by state authorities. By the late 1960s, Jones was suffering from progressive liver disease, which was the ultimate cause of his death.<BR>Jones's prison number, 114591, appears at the bottom of some of his drawings, placed there like a signature. Although a fellow inmate taught him to write his name, his spelling was inconsistent and he developed many curious variations.</P>
<P>Jones neither relinquished his dream of being released, nor wavered from his claim of innocence. As his health deteriorated, his artistic output remained constant. Early in February 1969 Jones's parole was finally granted. His health suddenly worsened, however, and he was admitted to the prison hospital. Two weeks later, on February 15, 1969, Jones died while still incarcerated. Funds from his drawings provided him with a dignified funeral, and his remains were returned to Clarksville for burial.</P>
<P>The drawings of Frank Jones provide valuable insight into the spiritual state and artistic vision of a remarkably talented man whose life was characterized by unfortunate events. If Jones found any consolation or avenues of escape from his prison confinement and the "devil haints" who taunted him, it was through their capture and imprisonment in his "devil houses". For as malevolent as they may have seemed, these "devil haints" were Jones's constant companions and his most intimate acquaintances.</P>

"2509","Artist Biography","<P>Raymond Jonson was a leader of the Transcendental Painting Group, an organization of artists formed in New Mexico in 1938. Devoted to nonrepresentational painting, the group aspired "to stimulate in others, through deep and spontaneous emotional experiences of form and color, a more intense participation in the life of the spirit."(1) The search for an artistic approach that went beyond descriptive realism concerned Jonson for most of his life. His early training, first at the school of the Portland, Oregon, art museum in 1909, and during the following three years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, provided a solid technical foundation from which he began more experimental work. When the 1913 Armory Show opened in Chicago, Jonson was especially impressed with Wassily Kandinsky's paintings. Kandinsky's book, On the Spiritual in Art, later provided a framework for Jonson's own ideas about the spiritual purpose of painting.(2)</P>
<P>Between 1913 and 1920, Jonson worked as the graphic art director of the experimental Chicago Little Theater and taught at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts.(3) In 1919, he received a fellowship to the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, which for the first time in his life allowed him to concentrate his full energies on painting for four months. The real turning point in his career, however, came three years later, during a summer visit to Santa Fe. Fascinated with the land and with American Indian design, he resolved to return, and in 1924, moved permanently to New Mexico.</P>
<P>Even before he left Chicago, Jonson had begun a series of paintings entitled Earth Rhythms, based on drawings done during his trip. In these paintings he explored the geologic structures of the Southwest in distinctly modernist terms. After his move, he did hundreds of sketches of the hills, mesas, and the eroded landscape, to acquaint himself spiritually with the forms, shapes, and rhythms of New Mexico.(4) His subsequent paintings reflect a dual commitment to the spiritual fulfillment he found in the land and to formal pictorial concerns: "I have always felt that there should be a governing sense of arrangement, that is, that a composition usually should have order and most often a simple basic motif of spaces, an interesting variety of shapes and spaces, a balance of line direction."(5) In the Earth Rhythms series, as well as in paintings of cliff dwellings, the Grand Canyon, and other Southwest landscape motifs, Jonson transformed nature's elements into highly geometric, rhythmic harmonies.</P>
<P>In 1931, Jonson began a series of abstractions based on letters of the alphabet which he called Variations ona Rhythm. "In only a few of them," he wrote, "is there any connection with the so called natural. They are entirely different from the Earth Rhythms. Most of them are entirely abstract except in that they do carry on an established rhythm indicated by the particular letter. . . . A – H – I are entirely independent of landscape."(6) InVariations on a Rhythm—H, which he selected to illustrate the brochure for his 1932 exhibition at the Studio Gallery in Chicago, hard edged, architectonic forms exist in illusionistic space. Despite Jonson's contention that the painting was independent of the landscape, vegetal forms in the lower right corner are residual reminders of Jonson's deeply felt connection to the land.</P>
<P>Late in 1931, Jonson made an extended trip to New York where he exhibited at the Delphic Studios. Afterward, he remarked not on the Gallatin Collection, or on the move by younger artists toward abstraction, but on paintings by Arthur Dove, Georgia O'Keeffe, and John Marin, whose landscape based abstractions seemed consonant with his own feelings.(7)<BR>In 1934, Jonson began teaching at the University of New Mexico. With Willard Nash, he did a series of murals under the auspices of the Public Works of Art Project, and later became one of the artists not on relief employed by the WPA.<BR>With the formation of the Transcendental Painting Group in 1938, Jonson was in the company of artists who shared similar views about the universal significance of art. They recognized the validity of various stylistic approaches as long as the work was nonrepresentational. In a statement of purpose, they commented that some members achieved the transcendental through "more occult and metaphysical" means, while others painted from "an intuitive emotional awareness," or even a more "scientific or intellectual balancing of elements." Whatever their personal inclinations, each sought an art that was "vitally rooted in the spiritual need of these times. . .," one that expressed "most truly creative, fundamental and permanent impulses emerging in the American continent."(8) Throughout his life, Jonson sought order and unity in his work. Whether abstracted from nature or entirely nonobjective, his paintings, he said, were "contrasts to the environment in which they exist." He continued, "Around us we have realism, strife, pain and greed. I wish to present the other side of life, namely the feeling of order, joy and freedom. By setting up my own plastic means I can at least thrill to the attempt of establishing some fundamental principles that are universal and enduring."(9)</P>

"2828","Artist Biography","<P>"If at times my productions do not express the conventionally beautiful, there is always an effort to express the universal beauty of man's continuous struggle to lift his social position and to add dimension to his spiritual being." -- Jacob Lawrence quoted in Ellen Harkins Wheat, <EM>Jacob Lawrence: The Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman Series of 1938-40</EM> (Hampton, Va.: Hampton University Museum; Seattle: in association with University of Washington Press, 1991), n.p.</P>
<P>The most widely acclaimed African American artist of this century, and one of only several whose works are included in standard survey books on American art, Jacob Lawrence has enjoyed a successful career for more than fifty years. Lawrence's paintings portray the lives and struggles of African Americans, and have found wide audiences due to their abstract, colorful style and universality of subject matter. By the time he was thirty years old, Lawrence had been labeled as the "foremost Negro artist," and since that time his career has been a series of extraordinary accomplishments. Moreover, Lawrence is one of the few painters of his generation who grew up in a black community, was taught primarily by black artists, and was influenced by black people.</P>
<P>Lawrence was born on September 17, 1917, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was the eldest child of Jacob and Rosa Lee Lawrence. The senior Lawrence worked as a railroad cook and in 1919 moved his family to Easton, Pennsylvania, where he sought work as a coal miner. Lawrence's parents separated when he was seven, and in 1924 his mother moved her children first to Philadelphia and then to Harlem when Jacob was twelve years old. He enrolled in Public School 89 located at 135th Street and Lenox Avenue, and at the Utopia Children's Center, a settlement house that provided an after school program in arts and crafts for Harlem children. The center was operated at that time by painter Charles Alston who immediately recognized young Lawrence'stalents.</P>
<P>Shortly after he began attending classes at Utopia Children's Center, Lawrence developed an interest in drawing simple geometric patterns and making diorama type paintings from corrugated cardboard boxes. Following his graduation from P.S. 89, Lawrence enrolled in Commerce High School on West 65th Street and painted intermittently on his own. As the Depression became more acute, Lawrence's mother lost her job and the family had to go on welfare. Lawrence dropped out of high school before his junior year to find odd jobs to help support his family. He enrolled in the Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal jobs program, and was sent to upstate New York. There he planted trees, drained swamps, and built dams. When Lawrence returned to Harlem he became associated with the Harlem Community Art Center directed by sculptor Augusta Savage, and began painting his earliest Harlem scenes.<BR>Lawrence enjoyed playing pool at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., where he met "Professor" Seifert, a black, self styled lecturer and historian who had collected a large library of African and African American literature. Seifert encouraged Lawrence to visit the Schomburg Library in Harlem to read everything he could about African and African American culture. He also invited Lawrence to use his personal library, and to visit the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of African art in 1935.</P>
<P>As the Depression continued, circumstances remained financially difficult for Lawrence and his family. Through the persistence of Augusta Savage, Lawrence was assigned to an easel project with the W.P.A., and still under the influence of Seifert, Lawrence became interested in the life of Toussaint L'Ouverture, the black revolutionary and founder of the Republic of Haiti. Lawrence felt that a single painting would not depict L'Ouverture's numerous achievements, and decided to produce a series of paintings on the general's life. Lawrence is known primarily for his series of panels on the lives of important African Americans in history and scenes of African American life. His series of paintings include: <EM>The Life of Toussaint L'Ouverture</EM>, 1937, (forty one panels), <EM>The Life of Frederick Douglass, 1938</EM>, (forty panels), <EM>The Life of Harriet Tubman</EM>, 1939, (thirty one panels), <EM>The Migration of the Negro,1940–41</EM>, (sixty panels), <EM>The Life of John Brown</EM>, 1941, (twenty two panels), <EM>Harlem</EM>, 1942, (thirty panels), <EM>War</EM>, 1946 47, (fourteen panels), <EM>The South</EM>, 1947, (ten panels), <EM>Hospital</EM>, 1949-50, (eleven panels), <EM>Struggle ?History of the American People</EM>, 1953–55, (thirty panels completed, sixty projected).<BR>Lawrence's best known series is <EM>The Migration of the Negro</EM>, executed in 1940 and 1941. The panels portray the migration of over a million African Americans from the South to industrial cities in the North between 1910 and 1940. These panels, as well as others by Lawrence, are linked together by descriptive phrases, color, and design. In November 1941 Lawrence's <EM>Migration</EM> series was exhibited at the prestigious Downtown Gallery in New York. This show received wide acclaim, and at the age of twenty four Lawrence became the first African American artist to be represented by a downtown "mainstream" gallery. During the same month Fortune magazine published a lengthy article about Lawrence, and illustrated twenty six of the series' sixty panels. In 1943 the Downtown Gallery exhibited Lawrence's <EM>Harlem </EM>series, which was lauded by some critics as being even more successful than the <EM>Migration</EM> panels.</P>
<P>In 1937 Lawrence obtained a scholarship to the American Artists School in New York. At about the same time, he was also the recipient of a Rosenwald Grant for three consecutive years. In 1943 Lawrence joined the U.S. Coast Guard and was assigned to troop ships that sailed to Italy and India. After his discharge in 1945, Lawrence returned to painting the history of African American people. In the summer of 1947 Lawrence taught at the innovative Black Mountain College in North Carolina at the invitation of painter Josef Albers.</P>
<P>During the late 1940s Lawrence was the most celebrated African American painter in America. Young, gifted, and personable, Lawrence presented the image of the black artist who had truly "arrived". Lawrence was, however, somewhat overwhelmed by his own success, and deeply concerned that some of his equally talented black artist friends had not achieved a similar success. As a consequence, Lawrence became deeply depressed, and in July 1949 voluntarily entered Hillside Hospital in Queens, New York, to receive treatment. He completed the <EM>Hospital </EM>series while at Hillside.</P>
<P>Following his discharge from the hospital in 1950, Lawrence resumed painting with renewed enthusiasm. In 1960 he was honored with a retrospective exhibition and monograph prepared by The American Federation of Arts. He also traveled to Africa twice during the 1960s and lived primarily in Nigeria. Lawrence taught for a number of years at the Art Students League in New York, and over the years has also served on the faculties of Brandeis University, the New School for Social Research, California State College at Hayward, the Pratt Institute, and the University of Washington, Seattle, where he is currently Professor Emeritus of Art. In 1974 the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York held a major retrospective of Lawrence's work that toured nationally, and in December 1983 Lawrence was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The most recent retrospective of Lawrence's paintings was organized by the Seattle Art Museum in 1986, and was accompanied by a major catalogue. Lawrence met his wife Gwendolyn Knight, a fellow artist, when he was a teenager. They were married in 1941, and their close and mutually supportive relationship has been an important factor in Lawrence's career.</P>

Lawrence never completed high school but taught himself African American history, spending hours in the library researching legendary black figures and events to use in his paintings. He worked for the Works Progress Administration in the late 1930s and in 1941 was the first African American artist to be represented by a New York gallery. Lawrence created several series of paintings that documented the stories of heroes such as Harriet Tubman and John Brown.

"2828","Artist Biography","<P>Lawrence was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey after his parents had moved north from Virginia and South Carolina. Following another move to Easton, Pennsylvania, his parents separated and his mother moved with Lawrence and his brother and sister to Philadelphia. In 1927, unable to support them, she placed the children in foster homes until she was able to settle in Harlem with them three years later, when Lawrence was thirteen. His own rootless youth combined with his interest in African American history made the movement of fugitive slaves and freed black people an ongoing theme of his art.</P>
<P>Lawrence's art education began in New York when he designed masks in a school program in Harlem run by Charles Alston, with whom he continued to study while in high school and in WPA art workshops beginning in 1932. In Alston's studio during the 1930s, he met many of the luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance, as well as his future wife, the painter Gwendolyn Knight. According to Lawrence, the purpose of his social realist art was to narrate the history of African Americans and to lift them out of economic slavery. His use of the series format—devoted to subjects such as Frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman, and "The Migration of the Negro"—represents his most direct effort to accomplish this goal.</P>

"3371","Artist Biography","<P>Laszlo Moholy Nagy came to the United States in 1937 to direct the New Bauhaus, an experimental school in art and design that was being established in Chicago. A prolific writer, as well as one of the most fertile experimental artists of his time, Moholy Nagy was a painter, photographer, filmmaker, builder of light space machines, teacher, and philosopher of new aesthetics. He believed that art offered a way to reorder society after the traumatic years of World War I, and he looked especially to technology to pave the way.</P><P>By 1937, when Moholy Nagy accepted the directorship of the New Bauhaus, he was well known in the United States? through the exhibition of his work at various New York museums, through his book The New Vision (the English language edition of which appeared in 1930), and through the various articles he had published in Cahiers d'Art. On arriving in Chicago, Moholy Nagy wrote his wife Sybil of the "strange town ? it is no culture yet, just a million beginnings." Just two weeks later, Chicago captivated him: "There's something incomplete about this city and its people that fascinates me; it seems to urge one on to completion. Everything seems still possible. The paralyzing finality of the European disaster is far away."(1) Although the New Bauhaus failed for lack of financial support, in January 1939 he opened the School of Design (later called the Institute of Design), which was specifically "founded on the principles and educational aims of the Bauhaus."(2)</P>
<P>At first the School of Design's financial struggle seemed constant. But, it soon affiliated with the Illinois Institute of Technology, and Moholy Nagy remained at the helm until his death from leukemia in 1946. Ironically, that was the year that returning servicemen on the GI Bill finally brought economic stability to the institution.(3)</P>
<P>A Hungarian, Moholy Nagy served as an artillery officer during World War I. In 1918, he received a law degree from the University of Budapest and four years later met Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. Gropius was impressed with the young Hungarian's art and his progressive ideas about its potential for improving society. Gropius invited Moholy Nagy to replace Johannes Itten, who had resigned as director of the Vorkurs in 1923. Josef Albers was already there, teaching the experimental preliminary course, when Moholy Nagy arrived.<BR>Moholy Nagy joined the Bauhaus at a moment of heated debate over the school's program. Gropius envisioned the Bauhaus as a school of industrial design, in which the arts and industry would merge. In his plan, students would contribute to improving the modern world by designing beautiful, functional objects that could be easily and inexpensively produced. New materials, made possible by technological advances, would be used for architectural design as well as for functional objects, and contribute to raising the standard of life for mankind.</P>
<P>However, not everyone within the Bauhaus was comfortable with these ideas. Itten disagreed with Gropius and left; Lyonel Feininger also opposed Gropius's promotion of the industrial arts. Nonetheless, the Bauhaus offered rich and exciting possibilities, and its faculty in 1926 included some of the most innovative thinkers of the day—Herbert Bayer, Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee, as well as Josef Albers, Lyonel Feininger, and Moholy Nagy. Moholy Nagy joined the proponents of the unification of art and industry, and with Walter Gropius, edited a series of fourteen books that defined the philosophical framework for the Bauhaus program.(4)</P>
<P>In 1928, in the face of increasing political pressure from outside, both Moholy Nagy and Gropius resigned. Moholy Nagy moved to Berlin, where he did stage design for the State Opera, the Piscator Theatre, and experimented with photography, film, and innovative graphic design. He spent 1934 doing advanced work with color film and photography in Amsterdam. The following year, he moved to London, where, in addition to making films, he published three volumes of documentary photographs. In 1935, he began making light space modulators—three dimensional "paintings" on transparent plastics, in which moving light sources cast changing shadows on etched and colored surfaces.</P>
<P>Moholy Nagy's early paintings reflected his youthful interest in German Expressionist painting. In the early 1920s, he met Kurt Schwitters and Paul Klee, and explored Dadaism. It was his contact with Russian Constructivism, though, that fueled both the style his art would take and his ideas about art's role as a vehicle for social change. Moholy Nagy, like Gropius, saw the machine as potentially dehumanizing and argued that the artist was uniquely capable of ameliorating its harmful potential. Yet Moholy Nagy took an essentially positive view of technology. He believed it offered opportunities for changing the world through mass production, distribution, and communication. He further believed that since art is rooted in society, the artist had a deep and abiding responsibility to address social issues. He saw the artist as a visionary—one who would provide the forms and ideas necessary for the understanding of future societies:</P>
<P>We need Utopians of genius to foreshadow the existence of the man of the future, who, in the instinctive and simple, as well as in the complicated relationships of his life, will work in harmony with the basic laws of his being.(5)</P>
<P>In 1939, Ilya Bolotowsky invited Moholy Nagy to join the American Abstract Artists, and he accepted with pleasure. Although he was unable to attend meetings or actively participate in the group's activities, Moholy Nagy exhibited annually and contributed a lengthy essay entitled "Space Time Problems in Art" to the 1946 Yearbook. When he acceptedmembership, though, he asked to be considered a painter and sculptor, rather than an architect of ideas, and generally showed paintings in the group's exhibitions.</P>

During World War II, when the shortage of industrial materials for household products became acute, Moholy Nagy's students experimented with a variety of alternatives for metal, including wooden bed springs, an infrared oven made of a garbage can for roasting meat, and string hung in doorways in place of screens.

Moholy Nagy was the youngest professor on the faculty and approached the school’s ideals enthusiastically as a teacher, editor, and writer. In 1933 the Nazi party closed the school, and he spent a few years in England before moving to Chicago to establish a “New Bauhaus,” known today as the Institute of Design.

"3993","Artist Biography","<P>Ad Reinhardt was one of the few members of the American Abstract Artists who began his artistic career as an abstract painter. The son of socialist parents, Reinhardt also had leftist sympathies and belonged to the Artists' Union and the left wing American Artists' Congress. Yet throughout his life Reinhardt insisted that art was created and should be understood on its own terms, without reference to social, political, or literary ideas. "In the Thirties," he later declared, "it was wrong for artists to think that a good social idea would correct bad art or that a good social conscience would fix up a bad artistic conscience. It was wrong for artists to claim that their work could educate the public politically or that their work would beautify public buildings."(1)</P>
<P>At Columbia University he studied art history and aesthetics with Meyer Schapiro. By the time he graduated in 1935, Reinhardt was well versed in modern art movements, and had contributed Cubist inspired cover designs for a campus magazine.(2) He then studied painting at the National Academy of Design, and with Anton Refregier, Francis Criss, and Carl Holty at the American Artists School. Between 1936 and 1941, he was employed by the easel division of the WPA Federal Art Project and at the same time did free lance commercial art. One of his most important associations was with Russel Wright, the architect and industrial designer, for whom Reinhardt did cartoons and exhibits for the 1939 New York World's Fair. During the 1940s, he made posters for the War Bond drive, did artwork for the Office of War Information, designed promotional materials for the Columbia Broadcasting System, created baseball magazines for the Brooklyn Dodgers, and painted murals for the Café Society and the Newspaper Guild Club.(3) He was in the navy in 1945 and 1946 and served briefly aboard ship in Salerno Bay before the war ended. In 1947 he accepted a teaching post at Brooklyn College.</P>
<P>Reinhardt had a thorough understanding of the historical progression and philosophical bases of modern art movements. His gentle, but acerbic wit garnered public attention in 1946 with his humorous and now well known cartoons for the Sunday section of PM, a leftist tabloid founded by Marshall Field to provide a contrasting voice to the generally conservative New York press.(4) The most famous of these cartoons, How to Look at Modern Art in America, showed a large tree, its trunk labeled "Braque, Matisse, Picasso." At the juncture of various branches was a scale of abstract art to Social Surrealist art, with Mondrian (the most abstract) on one side,and George Grosz at the opposite end. The tree's branches bore leaves with names of artists whose work was in some manner related. The abstract branches reached skyward; those indicating social realists, Surrealists, and Expressionists were about to break from the effect of weights labeled "subject matter", "Mexican art influence", and "War Art".(5) Although the cartoon was a humorous evaluation, Reinhardt received letters from Sinclair Lewis, among others, thanking him for clarifying the interrelationships among modern artists.<BR>Reinhardt joined the American Abstract Artists in 1937 at the invitation of Carl Holty: That was one of the greatest things that happened to me. All the great abstract artists—Mondrian, Léger and Albers—had come over, and then all the Americans that I admired—Holty, Diller, Balcomb Greene, Cavallon, McNeil and other post Cubist geometric abstractionists."(6) Reinhardt quickly became an active force within the organization, and in 1940, when the group picketed the Museum of Modern Art, ironically for showing the work of PM artists rather than the American avant garde, Reinhardt designed the broadside that presented the group's point of view.</P>
<P>His bold abstractions of the late 1930s, which Reinhardt called his "late classical mannerist post cubist, geometric abstractions," showed evidence of a sophisticated understanding of abstract composition.(7) He worked in collage as well as paint, bringing to this medium an all over compositional approach that signified his imminent move toward pure geometric structure. The Untitled painting of 1940, with its overlapping strokes of color, provides a painted parallel to the collages of the late 1930s. Yet his work retained clues to those artists he most admired. The optical energy of Red and Blue Composition (1941) owes a debt to the jazzy syncopations of Stuart Davis, who became a sort of mentor to the younger painter, though Reinhardt had not yet abdicated rhythmic curvilinear forms that bespoke his appreciation for Carl Holty.</P>
<P>In 1941 Reinhardt began to break up the geometric structure of his paintings. By 1948, he was exhibiting compositions that replaced visual form with calligraphic, all over patterns that put him in an uncomfortable alliance with Abstract Expressionism. By the 1950s, however, he moved again toward strict geometric purity, creating symmetrical, rectangular shapes in single colors that reflected his early appreciation of geometric abstraction. From that time until his death in 1967, Reinhardt continued to simplify and purify his paintings—purging the bold colors and eventually arriving at his black paintings, the solemn, reductivist canvases for which he is perhaps best known.</P>

This was followed by "rococo semi surrealist fragmentation and "all over" baroque geometric expressionist patterns of the early 40s." Next came "archaic color brick brushwork impressionism and black and white constructivist calligraphies of the late 40's"; then "early classical hieratical red, blue, black monochromes square cross beam symmetries of the 50's"; and last, "classic black square uniform five foot timeless trisected evanescenses of the 60's."
