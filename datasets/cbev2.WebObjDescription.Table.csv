By the time Twachtman painted his Connecticut landscapes, American artists and intellectuals had been interested in Buddhism for more than two decades, and the artist himself had studied Zen philosophy and Japanese art. (Pyne, "John Twachtman and the Therapeutic Landscape," in Chotner et al., <i>John Twachtman: Connecticut Landscapes</i>, 1989) This may account for the meditative quality of his pictures, the sense of looking not at an actual landscape, but at an inward image of something seen long before.</p>"

In Thaxter's gardens and on the rocky beaches, Hassam used the flickering brushwork and brilliant colors he had adopted in France to capture the spangled light of Appledore's brief summer. This painting evokes the leisurely, seasonal rhythms of America's privileged families in the last years before the Great War. A beautifully dressed woman shields her face from the sun; she looks down and away, as if absorbed in the song of a sandpiper, the island bird that inspired Celia Thaxter's most famous children's poem.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

At the turn of the twentieth century, the skyscraper symbolized all that was dynamic and powerful in America. Architects praised the new towers as symbols of mankind's reach for the heavens. But as the United States grew in power and prestige, the workers who provided the nation's muscle also seemed to threaten Hassam's orderly and prosperous world. The artist had won fame and fortune picturing New York for the delight of its moneyed class; the art, music, and fine manners surrounding this "blond Aryan girl" provided a buffer against the unruliness of America's immigrant society. If the skyscraper represents worldly ambition, the other vertical elements in the painting&#151;the lilies, the Hellenistic figurine, the panels of a beautiful oriental screen&#151;suggest a different kind of aspiration. But in 1918, the refined life this woman pursued in her elegant environment was already under attack by the reality of war and the clamor of a new century.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

Recent research, however, suggests that it is probably a copy done in the late nineteenth century. It is unusual for Byzantine artifacts to be replicated in this way, but at the turn of the twentieth century, many Russian museums were publishing their collections for the first time and copies were likely made from the photographs. Religious art flourished during the Byzantine period, and the interiors of churches were lavishly decorated to reflect the grandeur of heaven. As a result, altarpieces, icons, jewelry, and mosaics gleamed with gold, precious stones, and rich colors. Wealthy people in the Byzantine Empire wore jewelry containing icons of sacred figures as symbols of their devotion. This necklace is composed of a series of gold medallions, on which the images of Christ, his twelve apostles, and Constantine’s Cross have been illustrated in glass mosaic and gold paint.</p>"

Barnard’s description of the piece reflects late nineteenth-century attitudes about the “nature” of men and women. The man, who struggles to provide for his family, resists death. The woman, however, through her role as a mother, surrenders to the inevitable as a natural part of the cycle of life.</p>"

Such vividly colored western scenes proved to be a bonanza for the Union Pacific's chief rival, the Northern Pacific Railroad. Jay Cooke, the Philadelphia financier who owned the Northern Pacific, kept Moran on retainer for several years, generating nostalgic images that helped to draw thousands of greenhorns out to the farthest stops on his railroad.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

To create Lincoln’s face, he relied heavily on life casts made by sculptor Leonard Volk in 1860, the very year of the Cooper Union speech, which Saint-Gaudens had attended. On that memorable day, Saint-Gaudens was impressed with Lincoln’s height and the way he bowed his head as he acknowledged the people gathered before him.

In January 1934, artist Harry Gottlieb signed on with the PWAP and looked for American workers he could paint near his home in the artists' colony of Woodstock, New York. He found these men harvesting ice off lakes and streams as local men had done every winter since the early 1800s. They sawed the thick layer of natural ice into long strips and then cut off large blocks. As Gottlieb's painting shows, the red-faced workers dressed in warm coats used long hooks and wooden ramps to maneuver the slick, heavy ice into large commercial icehouses where they neatly stacked the blocks. Straw or sawdust packing minimized melting in warm weather. Throughout the year icehouses along the Hudson River stored ice that was shipped by train to New York City. Families and grocers put the ice into insulated iceboxes that kept food from spoiling. Artificial freezing dominated ice production after World War I, and then electric refrigerators became popular. When Gottlieb documented the natural ice business it was gradually melting away.<p><i>1934: A New Deal for Artists</i> exhibition label"

The Russian emigrant Bolotowsky induced fellow immigrants to pose for him. He noted, "All the four people in this picture were very carefully selected and are especially fitted for it: the barber a handsome Italian, the customers a Greek, the next one a nervous slim Irishman, the last one a heavy tough Irishman sitting clumsily in a dainty chair."

Each scene represents different phases of construction to show the drama, danger, and massive scale of the dam projects overseen by the government. </p><p>In the central panel a worker stands inside a section of conduit suspended above the canyon. He signals for his coworkers to direct the crane over the dam. Gropper emphasized the unity of workers who clearly rely on one another to get the job done. The men protect each other from injury as they shape the American landscape, invigorate the nation's economy, and provide electrification across the country. The stylized clouds and jagged mountains reflect the artist's effort to make the scene easily readable from a distance. In the finished mural, Gropper made subtle changes to his proposal, including a red handkerchief hanging from the back pocket of one of the workers. Gropper was a Communist, and this subtle statement of his sympathies was a subversive act for an artist whose government-commissioned work was supposed to reach broad audiences. The change generated no objections, and after Gropper installed the mural a <i>Washington Post</i> critic commended him, writing that his "design has unity and is appropriate in scale and color to the space for which it was planned."

But the title may have been a testament to the artist's faith in God's plan, and in fact, Borglum did enjoy success again. (A. Mervyn Davies, <i>Solon H.

The total work suggests a chancel complete with altar, a throne, offertory tables, pulpits, mercy seats, and other obscure objects of Hampton's own invention. His work also includes plaques, tags, and notebooks bearing a secret writing system which has yet to be, and may never be, deciphered.</p>  <p>Hampton's intricate, large-scale design for <i>The Throne</i> derives coherence from parallel rows of constructions, densely packed on several levels. A seven-foot tall cushioned throne at the rear center is the work's focal point. Pairs of objects on either side of it impart a powerful, compulsive sense of symmetry. To the actual throne's right, objects refer to the New Testament and Jesus; to the left, the Old Testament and Moses, a division that corresponds to the disposition of the saved in the Bible. Every item has a relationship to the others and most bear a dedication to a saint, prophet, or other biblical character that may have appeared in the recurrent visions that inspired Hampton's efforts.</p>  <p>Massive wings, suggesting angels, sprout from most components; framed tablets line the walls, and crowns and other complex foil decorations fill every available space of the assemblage. The entire complex was originally placed on a three-foot tall platform set stage like against the rear wall of his garage.</p>  <p><i>The Throne</i> and all of its associated components are made from discarded materials and found objects consisting of old furniture, wooden planks and supports, cardboard cutouts, scraps of insulation board, discarded light bulbs, jelly glasses, hollow cardboard cylinders, Kraft paper, desk blotters, mirror fragments and electrical cables and a variety of other "found objects," all scavenged from second-hand shops, the streets, or the federal office buildings in which he worked. To complete each element, Hampton used shimmering metallic foils and brilliant purple paper (now faded to tan) to evoke spiritual awe and splendor. Hampton's symbolism extended even to his choice of materials such as light bulbs, which represent God as the light of the world.</p>   <p>Praised as America's greatest work of visionary art, Hampton's <i>Throne</i> reveals one man's faith in God as well as his hope for salvation.  Although Hampton did not live to initiate a public ministry, the capping phrase "FEAR NOT" summarizes his project's universally eloquent message.</p><p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

At a party given at William Merritt Chase's studio, she met Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who asked to create her portrait. Her brother agreed, promising in return to paint the sculptor's son, Homer. This relief panel is slightly curved, so that it captures the light and the bronze takes on different colors. <p>Saint-Gaudens made unusual choices to create this work. This was part of an informal exchange of tokens between artists, but the sculptor gave the portrait the monumental and timeless gravity of a public memorial. The sculptor chose not to give Violet a conventional, formal pose, but caught her in the act of humming a pitch and tuning her guitar, as though she would shortly sing for her friends. Like an ancient Greek grave marker, this relief captures a fleeting and informal moment in Violet's life. It compresses into one image a love of music, learning, and art that characterized the circle of friends and fellow artists around the Sargents.<p>Exhibition Label, Smithsonian American Art Museum, 2006"

Gluck met artist Romaine Brooks in 1923, and the two agreed to sit for each other shortly thereafter, resulting in this portrait and an unfinished one of Brooks by Gluck. Like Brooks, Gluck frequently wore clothing inspired by men's fashions that concealed her feminine figure. This androgynous attire was popular among upper- and upper-middle-class women at the time. It allowed them to experiment with fashion, but it also provided an outlet for lesbians, like Gluck and Brooks, to question traditional gender roles. In a 1918 letter to her brother, Gluck wrote of her new look, "I am flourishing in a new garb. Intensely exciting. Everybody likes it," and went on to say, "I hope you will like it because I intend to wear that sort of thing always."

The artist hoped that this painting of animals grouped around a lavender-tinted tree would become a large mural to adorn a school. The mural would show urban schoolchildren American animals from a variety of environments. Denizens of the eastern coast and swamps inhabit the foreground: the Florida alligator basks below a flying American pelican and a tern; an anhinga spreads its wings to dry; and an egret stands in the lower right corner. The woodland animals are further back: a gray squirrel perches on a tree branch while the striped skunk, groundhog, black bear, wolverine, American porcupine, and red fox stand on the middle ground. In the background are creatures native to the western plains and mountains: the coyote, turkey vulture, pronghorn antelope, mountain lion, and mountain goat. Like the children for whom he painted, Turney lived in New York. He probably knew the gray squirrels of Central Park better than the other animals in the picture, which he saw only in pictures and New York-area zoos.<p><i>1934: A New Deal for Artists</i> exhibition label"

Segal rejected the "rule" against casting, as he had rejected the pressure to paint abstractions in the 1950s.

Within a few years, the General Services Administration held a trial to assess how the work affected the use of the plaza. Surprisingly, of the 180 people who testified, 122 <i>supported</i> the sculpture while 58 favored relocation. Those opposed compared it to the Berlin Wall and the iron curtain and suggested relocating the piece to a site near the Hudson River. Although opinion was evenly divided, the GSA decided that <i>Tilted Arc</i> should be dismantled. In 1986, Serra sued the government for breach of contract and his right to freedom of expression and due process, arguing that <i>Tilted Arc</i> was designed specifically for that site and would lose all meaning anywhere else. District Attorney Rudolph Giuliani responded that neither the First nor the Fifth Amendment was applicable, since Serra had voluntarily sold his "speech" to the GSA. The Court of Appeals agreed, ruling that the government had the right to modify, censor, or destroy <i>Tilted Arc</i>. The sculpture was dismantled on March 15, 1989.

He might have seen the figure of a young Ethiopian queen as a symbol of strength and unity, representing not just his immediate family but the African American community as a whole.

I have ascertained, on a careful enquiry, that about one in ten or twelve of the whole tribe are what the French call ‘cheveux gris,’ or greyhairs; and that this strange and unaccountable phenomenon is not the result of disease or habit; but that it is unquestionably a hereditary character which runs in families, and indicates no inequality in disposition or intellect.

(Letter from Sharp to Mr. Ewers, Taos, New Mexico, August 8, 1948) In 1898, Sharp was one of the first artists to set up a studio in Taos, where he persuaded his sitters to dress in clothing from his own collection of native artifacts. Art critics praised Sharp for his ability “to assemble around his subjects authentic paraphernalia, which gives the true atmosphere of their romantic past.” In this portrait the spare background and broad brushwork focus our attention on the girl’s facial features. Sharp also eliminated any props that might hint at the modern world in which his models existed.

This "divide and conquer" policy, together with thrilling narratives of white captives carried off to slavery, helped ease the consciences of European Americans making their way across the continent.

At the base of this wall there is a level prairie, of half a mile in width, running parallel to it; in any and all parts of which, the Indians procure the red stone for their pipes, by digging through the soil and several slaty layers of the red stone, to the depth of four or five feet.

I mean the prairie, whose enameled plains that lie beneath me, in distance soften into sweetness, like an essence; whose thousand velvet covered hills, (surely never formed by chance, but grouped in one of Nature's sportive moods)---tossing and leaping down with steep or graceful declivities to the river's edge, as if to grace its pictured shores, and make it ‘a thing to look upon.’” (Catlin, <i>Letters and Notes</i>, vol. 2, no. 32, 1841; reprint 1973)</p>"

In the mural, a woman uses sticks to harvest the rice from the stalks, while a man hunts birds with his bow and arrow and another prepares to spear a fish from the stream. This mural would have served as a testimony to the abundance of the land, the value of living on it wisely, and lessons to be learned from its first people. Martin’s image reflects the sympathies of many WPA muralists, who openly expressed the need for images of Native Americans in their New Deal murals. One of Martin’s fellow WPA artists argued that “a reminder . . . to anyone of us of the life in this country that preceded ours can do no harm, especially since that life, in its simplicity and harmony with nature, can be a lesson to us in many ways.” (Park and Markowitz, <i>Democratic Vistas: Post Offices and Public Art in the New Deal</i>, 1984)</p>"

Stanley Lechtzin compares the process to those found in nature, saying, “It brings to mind crystal growth, the growth of coral under the sea, and the multiplication of simple organisms as observed under a microscope. In this, I experience a relationship between technology and nature.” Lechtzin was attracted to the technique because he could make large-scale pieces that were still very light, compared to the torques worn in ancient cultures.</p>"

Still, <i>Evening Rendezvous</i> is a deeply political painting. The abstract dabs of white emerging from a gray twilight are hooded Klansmen, gathered around a bonfire suggested by the hot reds at the center of the image. Angular white shapes evoke the men closest to the headlights of their cars, while at the top of the canvas, others are obscured by blue smoke. The combination of red, white, and blue mocks the patriotism that the Klan claimed in its defense.<p>Most New York art critics in the 1950s and 1960s insisted that painting could be about nothing except painting. Any artist who argued otherwise risked bad press and lost sales. This climate might have led Lewis to proclaim that his art was meant solely to express "man's creative endeavors." <i>Evening Rendezvous</i> veered close to the forbidden territory of figural painting, and more importantly, it brought the turmoil of the civil rights movement into the gallery.

He used this word not only to refer to the spiritual but also to the strong contrasts of light and dark colors, absolutes that express extremes of human experience.<p>The radiant ochre shape on the left is both a stylized, six-pointed Star of David and a form that Motherwell called a "figure" in other paintings. On the right is a darker shape that the artist also described as a figure. If we read this image from right to left&mdash;as we would the Torah&mdash;the painting evokes the Jews' passage from the darkness of the Holocaust to the joy of living freely and in obedience to the Commandments.<p>Motherwell fought against the tendency of modern artists to isolate themselves from the world while they searched for a pure art.

As an adolescent, Lorne had stopped speaking to his mother and had moved out of his parents' home. He felt his mother was too controlling and did not understand him because she made him dress in togas and would not let him play with children his own age.

The archive also includes a sixty-eight-foot-long scale model; more than 240 documentary photographs by Wolfgang Volz in color and black-and-white; a film by the critically acclaimed filmmakers David Maysles, Charlotte Zwerin, and Albert Maysles; documents; 324 color slides; original components, including one of the 2,050 nylon fabric panels; a twenty-one-foot steel pole, three and one-half  inches in diameter, with steel cables and guy wires; one of the 13,000 specially designed anchors; and a few of the 350,000 hanging hooks.</p> <p><i>Running Fence, Sonoma and Marin Counties, California, 1972&ndash;76, A Documentation Exhibition</i> is the first major Christo and Jeanne-Claude complete project archive to be acquired by a museum.</p> <p>The <i>Running Fence</i> is considered one of the most important early public art projects, and when it was installed in 1976, it was the most ambitious work undertaken by Christo and Jeanne-Claude since their 1964 arrival in the United States. When it was unveiled during America's bicentennial, it captured the public's imagination. The sheer beauty of the light and weather playing across the fabric of the fence stood in sharp contrast to the underlying issue of division and limitations that fences generally convey. For Christo and Jeanne-Claude, the fence embodied larger issues of human freedom and constraint. The planning, design, installation, and critical response to the <i>Running Fence</i> set the tone for each of their subsequent major public projects. None would have been imaginable without it.  </p> <p>From 1972 when the <i>Running Fence</i> was first conceived until 1976 when it was completed, Christo and Jeanne-Claude faced seemingly insurmountable challenges. In addition to negotiating land rights with fifty-nine ranchers, Christo and Jeanne-Claude grappled with bureaucratic hurdles at a time when the artists had no fame to pave the way. Christo and Jeanne-Claude convinced ordinary Americans of the transformative power of art.<p>New Acquisitions</p>"

Inspired by the "collaborative challenge" at the 1999 AAW symposium, thirty-two members of the guild decided to undertake a group project to build a lathe completely from turned wood. Over six months they designed and crafted each individual part, including the motor, chisels, and nuts and bolts, using a total of thirty-one different hardwoods. The lathe is mechanically accurate and demonstrates the combined skill and craftsmanship of all those involved in the project."

Like many of Kathleen Royster Lamb's pieces, leaves and thorns play a prominent role in the interpretation of the design. To Lamb, the leaves signify a protective layer while the thorns symbolize pain. Lamb considers the pear shape to be a feminine form where the leaves protect the fruit's fleshy, delicate core from the thorns of the creamer and sugar bowl. By exposing the core of the fruit, she wants to create a feeling of vulnerability and drama. Lamb intentionally emphasized the length of each pear's stem in an attempt to represent the balance, or lack thereof, that we find within ourselves.

Some of the type blocks are as much as two hundred years old and include carved maple, birch, ebony, walnut and mahogany, as well as forged metal pieces. In 1964, when Schermer's newspaper in Missoula, Montana, converted from typeset printing to offset lithography (which uses photography to transfer the image of each page of a newspaper), he salvaged much of the old type and stored it in his home until he could decide what to do with it. Almost thirty years later, Schermer began working with the type, using a strong solvent to clean the ink from the typeface, then waxing and buffing the sculptural bits before mounting them to a support. <i>An American Puzzle</i> is a richly abstracted field of shapes that evokes an archaeological remnant, a layer of history rescued from a "dig." It suggests the visual impact of the printed page as well as the thousands of voices that contribute to a community's history over the generations. Schermer has served on several boards within the Smithsonian, and the wide variety of elements in this piece reflects the broad interests of the institution as well as the artist's memories of the publishing business.</p>

The series was inspired by an encounter with his children, in which they mistook an image of an atomic blast for a weather phenomenon.

The corporation contracted Mildred Constantine, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, to consult on art for its new campus, which was completed in 1975. Having recently juried the International Biennial of Tapestry in Lausanne, Switzerland, Constantine convinced AT&amp;T to furnish its offices with contemporary textiles. Hicks's commission, the largest for the complex, consisted of two eight-foot-by-twenty-two-foot tapestries hung on opposite sides of a glass staircase leading to the executive suites. Walking between these rich fiber walls evoked the feeling of entering a rainforest.
<P>Hicks's architectural installations are considered ambitious expressions in post-war American art and contributed to shifting the perception of fiber from simply a domestic pursuit to an artist's medium. She has shown a particular sensitivity to weaving traditions, as well as the interplay of color, texture, and space, demonstrating the influence of her education under renowned colorist Josef Albers, his wife, the prominent weaver Anni Albers, and architect Louis Kahn. She was recognized by the American Institute of Architects in 1974 with a gold medal for "the successful integration of art and architecture."</P>
<P>AT&amp;T's textile collection was disbanded when the campus was sold in 2002. Bob and Lynn Johnston, friends of Hicks devoted to the preservation of her work, purchased the tapestries and shipped them to Paris, where Hicks has maintained her studio since 1964. Using the original bolts of hand-woven Bangalore silk, linen thread, and embroidery cotton—materials left dormant for thirty years—Hicks and the small staff responsible for their original manufacture painstakingly restored the work. </P>

The cramped space of this composition, made even more confined by the two horizontal planks across the window frame, creates a feeling of tension and claustrophobia.</P>
<P>This drawing is charged with ambiguities and possibilities. What are the figures looking at? What is their relationship? Are they both even looking at the same thing? Why is the doll missing parts of her body? Does her truncated body suggest the limited opportunities the little girl will face? Do the two boards across the window simply confine the figures, or do they also represent how the lives of these two figures are barred from full development by restrictions imposed on people of their race? This powerful composition expresses the anxieties of African American people in pre-civil rights days without reference to a specific incident. </P>
<P>White's bold composition and intensity of expression in this drawing make it one of his most memorable images. His mastery of line to suggest the distinct textures of skin, hair, cloth, and wood, reveal his stature as one of the leading draftsmen of the twentieth century. </P>

In this painting, Wiley looked to the work of Hieronymous Bosch (about 1450–1516) to express his dismay at the consequences of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukraine. His friend Holbrook Teter visited the town of Grebeny, in Belarus, with a group of health professionals several years after the incident and shared his notes with Wiley. Grebeny was a village located well into the zone contaminated by radiation. People who fled the incident had returned because they had nowhere else to settle. The hopelessness and desolation of deformed animals, of people eating food and breathing air that was poisoning them, was so overwhelming to Wiley that his first attempts to convey the devastation seemed totally inadequate. In this painting he dramatically enlarged the detail of a village in flames from the central panel of Bosch's triptych <I>The Temptation of St. Anthony</I> (about 1500) to express his horror at the nuclear accident at Chernobyl.

It provides unprecedented insight into Paik's creative process, his sources of inspiration, and the communities of artists on three continents with whom he worked for more than five decades beginning in the 1950s. The collective archive includes thousands of individual items that will be catalogued during the next several years. </p>  <p>The Archive includes early writings on art, history, and technology, correspondence with key artists and collaborators such as Charlotte Moorman and John Cage, a complete collection of videotapes used in his work, production notes for videotape and television projects, plans for video installations, documentation of large-scale television projects such as <i>Guadalcanal Requiem</i> (1977/1979) and installations including the massive <i>The More the Better</i> (1988), sketches, notebooks, and models. The archive also includes a full range of technology that Paik worked with, including a variety of early models of televisions and video projectors, old radios, record players, cameras, and musical instruments supplemented by technical manuals. It includes notes and hand-drawn plans for the Paik-Abe video synthesizer&mdash;invented in 1969 with Japanese engineer Shuya Abe&mdash;that transformed electronic moving-image making. Additional materials that provide insight into Paik's career are unpublished interviews, audiotapes, vintage photographs, documentation of early Fluxus performances from before and after Paik's move to New York City in 1964, flyers, announcements, posters, catalogues, and works in progress. A variety of toys, games, folk sculptures, banners, wall hangings, and the desk where he painted in his studio are also part of the Archive.</p>  <p>John G.

"2010.29                                   ","New Acquisition Label","Kerry James Marshall is one of the leading contemporary painters of his generation. Over the past twenty-five years, he has become internationally known for monumental images of African American history and culture. Marshall attributes his interest in these subjects to the geography of his upbringing. Born in Birmingham, Alabama just as the bus boycotts were beginning, the artist and his family moved to the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, in 1963 (two years before the race riots) and finally settled in South Central Los Angeles at the height of the civil rights movement. The experience of growing up at the epicenter of socio-political change has yielded a body of work deeply rooted in personal biography and historical detail.
<P><I>SOB, SOB</I> evokes Marshall's intellectual journey over the last fifty years beginning with his boyhood visits to the local library. According to the artist, by the third and fourth grades he knew "every single art book in the library," and by the seventh grade he was taking summer classes at the Otis Art Institute. <I>SOB, SOB</I> reflects this thirst for information. It is a painting about the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge, and relates closely to Marshall’s ongoing exploration of African American history.</P>
<P>The painting depicts a female figure seated in front of a tall shelf of African history books. A volume titled <I>Africa since 1413</I> lies at her feet as she gazes into the sunlit interior. It’s unclear whether her contemplative gaze is one of wistful longing for a pre-colonial past or anguish over the transformation of the African continent that began in 1413 with European expeditionary missions. A thought bubble floating above the girl's head further complicates this emotional ambiguity. The text can be read as either a cry of despair or a pointed expression of anger.</P>
<P>Painted in 2003, <I>SOB, SOB</I> marks a pivotal moment in Marshall's career as one of the first paintings to address the idea of black aesthetics. The term "black aesthetics" first emerged in the early 1960s as a means of promoting racial equality and fostering black cultural pride. Writers, musicians, and visual artists of the period imbued their work with the tones and textures of African American heritage to create a unique form of expression. Marshall's own exploration of black aesthetics grows out of previous paintings like <I>The Garden Project</I> series (1995), which focused on the failed utopia of urban renewal through federal housing projects. <I>SOB, SOB</I> not only represents a new conceptual direction for Marshall, but also a stylistic shift from the glitter-encrusted <I>Souvenir</I> paintings (1998–2002) that commemorate cultural heroes of the civil rights era. In contrast, <I>SOB, SOB</I> presents a spare interior space very different from these earlier works. Here we see Marshall at his most serious and technically refined, meditating on the events that have shaped the lives of African Americans today. </P>

In her hands, these humble objects become new again, revealing the potential of things we seldom give a second glance.

Although he had just finished the sixty panels of his epic <I>Migration</I> series, he had only second-hand knowledge of the South, the point of origin for thousands of rural blacks who had made the great migration to industrial cities of the urban north. The South was a new experience for the young New Yorker. Lawrence's mother had come from Virginia, his father from South Carolina, so as he remarked in 1961: "[In 1941] if you weren't born in the South, your parents were. Your life had a whole Southern flavor; it wasn't an alien experience to you even if you had never been there."
<P><I>Bar and Grill</I> shows the interior of a café that is divided by a floor-to-ceiling wall that separates the commercial space into two realms—one occupied by whites, the other by blacks. Apart from obvious segregation by race, the image also reveals status. White customers drink in comfort, cooled by a ceiling fan above. The number of figures occupying each side of the room reflected the white-black ratio of city residents.</P>
<P>Living in a southern city where legislation required that he ride in the back of city buses and live in a racially segregated neighborhood, Lawrence discovered the daily reality of Jim Crow segregation.

The show was a huge success for Lawrence, who was celebrated by black and white critics alike. Halpert continued to push Lawrence's work, and two years later, when Lawrence was drafted to serve as a steward in the Coast Guard, she persuaded his commanding officers to provide studio space so he could continue to paint.</P>

She strives to maintain a closeness to nature by creating a personal interpretation of it. In <i>The Lily Pool,</i> Ferren's loose brushstrokes and vivid colors create an impression of a refreshing pond, alive with beautiful water lilies. The water's reflection of the surrounding landscape almost makes us feel as if we are standing amid the lush vegetation. Ferren's emphasis on light and the visible brushstrokes recall paintings by the French impressionists. The bright colors were likely inspired by the palette of postimpressionist French painter Pierre Bonnard (1867&#8211;1947), who also used vibrant blues and greens in his depictions of sunlit gardens.</p>"

Saint-Gaudens accepted the commission and approached his friend Adolph Weinman to execute his design. President Roosevelt, whose personal interests ranged from literature to natural history, held very specific ideas about art. To appeal to the president's unpretentious taste, Saint-Gaudens designed a simple obverse featuring Roosevelt's profile and the Latin phrase <i>Aequum cuique,</i> a translation of his campaign slogan, "A square deal for every man." The reverse features a proud eagle, the sculptor's favorite coin motif, and an inscription indicating the place and date of the inauguration. Tiffany and Company cast 125 of these medals in bronze and struck an additional three in gold. Upon receiving his gold medal, President Roosevelt wrote to Saint-Gaudens saying, "Thank Heaven we have at last some artistic work of permanent worth done for the government."

Taft and Sherman did not pose for the Davison designer. Instead, they sat for a photographer, and the designer used these photographs to model the portraits. Taft later wrote that his medal was "beautiful" and was thrilled to have it and the other inaugural souvenirs as "remembrances of the occasion."

"2011.13                                   ","New Acquisition Label","Allan D'Arcangelo has long been considered a leading figure among the first generation of American Pop artists. <I>US Highway 1</I> is a quintessential example of D'Arcangelo’s work and an iconic Pop image. In 1962, D'Arcangelo embarked on a series of pictures depicting US Highway 1 on the East Coast. This painting was the first in the series, and served as inspiration for five similar works created between 1962 and 1963. As such, <I>US Highway 1</I> is a seminal work in D'Arcangelo's oeuvre and a prime example of his signature compositional format: a long strip of asphalt cutting through the landscape and plunging toward a vanishing point on the distant horizon. Dark green silhouettes of trees flank the two-lane highway. The sky above is a solid plane of dark blue. The space is both flat and penetrating. Signs along the highway appear to float over the road as if time has been suspended. This surreal, almost dreamlike quality indicates a major difference between D'Arcangelo's conception of the highway and road imagery presented to the American public by writers such as Jack Kerouac and photographers like <A href="http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=8565">Robert Frank</A>. The latter see the road as a place where things happen, where rites of passage occur and stories unfold. For D'Arcangelo, the road is a place without time and without characters—just the hypnotic repetition of road signs and billboards and the forward motion of the car.

Her work explores notions of beauty, sexuality and black female identity. Thomas's use of rhinestones and vivid textile patterns adds an even greater sense of drama and sensuality to her paintings. She is one of many contemporary artists experimenting with non-traditional materials, particularly glitter and sequins. For Thomas, the rhinestones evoke folk art traditions and Haitian voodoo art. They also serve as a metaphor for female beauty products, which can both enhance and mask a woman's identity.
<P>Thomas's work stems from her study of art history and the classical genres of portraiture, landscape, and still life, and is inspired by a wide range of sources, from Hudson River School landscapes to Henri Matisse’s nudes and Romare Bearden's collages. Although her paintings often reference the familiar compositional arrangements of odalisque paintings, Thomas imbues her subjects with an agency and action seldom seen in the canon of figurative painting. <I>Portrait of Mnonja</I> is a stunning example of Thomas's recent work. The reclining figure is posed in a sassy contrapposto and situated against a wood-paneled background redolent of a seventies-era living room. She wears a loose-fitting white blouse with a plunging neckline, and her hair is pulled back in a low bun. Her right hand rests on her knee, revealing nail polish that matches her audacious pink heels. She exudes dignity and self-assurance.</P>

"2011.32                                   ","New Acquisition Label","Matthias Pliessnig's extraordinary amorphous furniture has its unlikely roots in the history of wooden boat-building. While studying at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Pliessnig, fellow student Benjamin Wooten, and professor Tom Loeser embarked on a project to each build a simple skiff for use on the town's surrounding lakes. Muddling through the basics of marine design required learning to steam-bend wood, an ancient technique that effectively boils the resin inside wood, rendering the stock malleable. Use of steam-bending is evident in the shape of boat hulls across the globe but has only influenced furniture design sporadically, including the eighteenth-century development of the Windsor chair and the nineteenth-century catalogue of the Austrian firm Gebrüder Thonet.
<P>Pliessnig's epiphany was the realization that a boat's skeleton—the "stations" running from port to starboard, and "stringers" running from bow to stern—could be adapted for seating by flipping the form upside down and contouring it to the body. His experimentation with this design process since 2006 has produced a rapidly evolving series of furniture, each piece more technically ambitious than the last. <I>Drift</I> is the most recent work in this series.</P>
<P>The steam-bending process is unusual enough in contemporary furniture to merit further description. Strips of wood are first air-dried, then soaked in water for several hours before being placed in a steam box. Wood is both saturated with water and heated, rendering the resin inside pliable and the wood extremely malleable. When the wood is removed it must be bent into position and clamped into place within thirty seconds, after which it will cool, regaining rigidity. During this finite window the wood fibers will slip around each other to meet the stock's new form, allowing the wood to maintain its original strength (as opposed to sawn wood, in which the fibers are cut and weakened). After remaining clamped in position for six to eight hours the wood will maintain its new shape permanently.</P>
<P>The pace of this work necessitated by this process is frenetic, but it is not improvisational. Pliessnig designs his pieces using Rhinoceros 3-D software before attempting to recreate the designs in wood. Because the program cannot account for the limitations of organic materials, the transition from screen to object can be enormously challenging. Pliessnig has stated that <I>Drift</I> includes his most difficult bends to date. This also is only the third piece to include pegged joints, the others being <I>Rivulet</I> (with bamboo) and <I>Amada</I> (with birch), both in private collections. Although the pegs appear to offer structural reinforcement, the sheer number of points of contact in Pliessnig's work (approximately 7000 in <I>Drift</I>) makes it incredibly strong, and the pegs serve more as a labor-intensive embellishment.</P>

"2011.36A-D                                ","New Acquisition Label","Alexis Rockman (b. 1962) has been depicting the natural world for more than two decades. Rockman spent his childhood exploring the halls of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where he developed an early passion for the natural sciences. He began painting at the age of twenty-one and quickly established himself in the New York art scene with eerily seductive paintings of organic processes and teeming life-forms. Since then, Rockman has gained international acclaim for his unique synthesis of art and science. Each meticulously rendered painting is an amalgam of historical research, scientific observation and unbridled imagination. Rockman's sources include botanical illustrations, habitat dioramas, nineteenth-century landscape painting, sci-fi film, and first-hand field study.
<P>In recent years, Rockman has focused more explicitly on environmental issues, combining empirical fact with plausible fiction to proffer an apocalyptic vision of the future. This is nowhere more evident than in his masterpiece, <I>Manifest Destiny.</I> While Rockman has always dealt with the fracture between the nature and culture, <I>Manifest Destiny</I> is his first work to confront the climate crisis. The painting comprises four contiguous panels extending twenty-four feet in length, and depicts the Brooklyn waterfront several hundred years in the future. The composition is framed by the ruins of two bridges. On the far left panel a futuristic suspension bridge lies beneath the elevated waters of the East River, where the Manhattan Bridge once stood. The historic Brooklyn Bridge stands in ruinous decay on the far right panel of Rockman's painting, a victim of its own aging infrastructure. But the end of modern civilization does not mark the end of all life. On the contrary, <I>Manifest Destiny</I> is teeming with organic growth. Rockman uses the image of urban decay to demonstrate the adaptive powers of nature. The presence of local flora and fauna confirms that life, in many forms, will persist even if humanity does not.</P>
<P>This is a seminal painting by Rockman. In addition to being a technical tour-de-force, it represents four years of intensive research and collaboration with engineers, architects, and climatologists. It is a painting steeped in art historical reference, but profoundly forward-looking. The Smithsonian American Art Museum offers an ideal context for such a multivalent work. Not only does it connect to works, like Walton Ford's <I><A href="http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=76772">Tur</A>,</I> but it also relates to the museum's collection of nineteenth-century landscape painting. And the Smithsonian-wide emphasis on natural science and biodiversity affords a still richer framework for understanding this work.</P>

Together, these works illuminate one of the rare talents of American art. Separately, they provide enchanting glimpses into Ryder's world of literary figures and poetic metaphors.
<P><I>The Lorelei,</I> one of the painter's larger canvases, is the only painting by Ryder that links love and death in a way so intriguing to late nineteenth-century artists, poets, and musicians. Ryder based his work on Heinrick Heine's famous poem in which Lorelei was an evil seductress, similar to the Greek siren. She lived atop a high rock along the treacherous narrows of the Rhine River. With her irresistible song, she enchanted passing sailors, who strove to reach her. Here a sailor tries to steer his craft toward the nymph on the rock but is sucked to his death in whirlpools and rapids, as are all others. Heine's <I>The Lorelei</I> was translated and widely published in America and put to music by numerous composers. Ryder quite possibly was familiar with Friedrich Silcher's popular melody of the verse, for friends often heard him "sing the song of the Lorelei" while working on the painting during his night sessions.</P>
<P>Ryder was obsessed with this dark and brooding scene, which he worked over more than any of his other paintings. The tragic scene and his inability to let it go may in fact symbolize Ryder's realization that he was never to find a woman to love. From the mid-1890s until his death in 1917, he strove for the perfection of his inner vision, even though he pronounced the painting "finished" in 1896. Visitor after visitor remarked on the constantly changing position of Lorelei within the painting.</P>
<P><I>The Lorelei</I> originally was intended for Helen Ladd Corbett, daughter of Portland, Oregon, banker William Ladd and a close friend of Charles Erskine Scott Wood, one of Ryder's major patrons who acted as intermediary. Mrs. Corbett even paid for it, but never received the painting. For unknown reasons the painting went to Wood after the artist's death and remained in the Wood family until 1957. Alastair Martin purchased <I>The Lorelei</I> in 1959, and his son, Robin Martin, gave the painting to the museum in 2011. In 2005, Alastair Martin presented the museum with Ryder's early, small painting <I><A href="http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=74942">The Lovers' Boat</A>,</I> depicting two blissful lovers in romantic moonlit and suggesting the painter’s optimism towards finding love.

The tale of the Lorelei became popular in the mid-nineteenth century when German poet Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) penned a poem about her, which a number of composers set to music. Ryder's image is based on the second and third stanzas of the poem (above), and his friends reported that he sang "the song of the Lorelei" while working on this painting.

According to German folklore, the Lorelei is an evil seductress who lives on a large rock above the Rhine River. Much like the sirens of Greek mythology, she beguiles sailors with her singing, luring their ships to destruction. There actually exists such a rock, marking the river's narrowest point between the North Sea and Sweden. The strong current and submerged rocks make this area dangerous to navigate and it has been the scene of many shipwrecks throughout history. Ryder worked on <i>The Lorelei</i> for many years. He wrote in 1896 that he'd finished the painting, but continued to rework the canvas until his death, more than twenty years later. Ryder struggled with where to place the "witching maiden," and over the years his glazes faded, causing the figure to blend into the rocks behind her.

Melancholy is both male and female, dark and light.
